MTBLS2806,SNAP25 inhibits glioma progression by regulating synapse plasticity via GLS-mediated glutaminolysis,"<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Neuronal activity regulated by synaptic communication exerts an important role in tumorigenesis and progression in brain tumors. Genes for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) annotated with the function vesicle about synaptic connectivity were identified and one of these proteins, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), was found to have discrepant expression levels in neuropathies. However, the specific mechanism and prognostic value of SNAP25 during glioma progression remain unclear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Using RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the differential synaptosis-related genes between LGG and GBM were identified as highly correlated. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and survival analysis indicated that the candidate gene SNAP25 could differentiate the outcome of low- and high-risk patients, and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohort was used for validation of the data set. RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry assays were performed to examine the expression level of SNAP25 in glioma cells and samples. Functional assays were performed to identify the effects of SNAP25 knockdown and overexpression on cell viability, migration, and invasion. Then, an immunofluorescence assay of the xenograft tissue was applied to evaluate the expression of the neuronal dendron formation marker-MAP2. Liquid chromatography-high re solution mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was presented for identifying crucial metabolic disturbances in glioma cells. In situ mouse xenograft model was used to investigate the role of SNAP25 in vivo.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> SNAP25 was down expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines and low-level SNAP25 indicated an unfavorable prognosis of glioma patients. SNAP25 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and fostered glutamate metabolism of glioma cells, exerting a tumor suppressor role. SNAP25 overexpression expressed lower expression of MAP2, indicating poor neuronal plasticity and connectivity. SNAP25 could interact with glutaminaseGLSand GLS knockdown could rescue the anti-tumor effect of SNAP25 in glioma cells. Moreover, upregulation of SNAP25 also decreased tumor volume and prolonged the overall survival (OS) of the xenograft mouse.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> SNAP25 inhibited carcinogenesis of glioma via sponging glutamate metabolism by regulating GLS expression, as well as inhibiting dendritic formation, which could be considered as a molecular target for glioma diagnosis and therapy.</p>",glutamate metabolism; synaptic plasticity; Glutaminase; glioma; SNAP25; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites,glutamate metabolism; synaptic plasticity; Glutaminase; glioma; SNAP25; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites,SNAP25 inhibits glioma progression by regulating synapse plasticity via GLS-mediated glutaminolysis. 10.3389/fonc.2021.698835.,,,"<p><strong>Patients and specimens:</strong></p><p>All 40 glioma tissues samples and 8 normal samples were obtained from patients who had received surgery and chemotherapy at Zhujiang Hospital (Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China).

MTBLS78,SpaceM reveals metabolic states of single cells,"<p>A growing appreciation of the importance of cellular metabolism and revelations concerning the extent of cell-cell heterogeneity demand metabolic characterization of individual cells. We present SpaceM, an open-source method for in situ single-cell metabolomics that detects &gt;100 metabolites from &gt;1,000 individual cells per hour, together with a fluorescence-based readout and retention of morpho-spatial features. We validated SpaceM by predicting the cell types of cocultured human epithelial cells and mouse fibroblasts. We used SpaceM to show that stimulating human hepatocytes with fatty acids leads to the emergence of two coexisting subpopulations outlined by distinct cellular metabolic states. Inducing inflammation with the cytokine interleukin-17A perturbs the balance of these states in a process dependent on NF-kappaB signaling. The metabolic state markers were reproduced in a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We anticipate SpaceM to be broadly applicable for investigations of diverse cellular models and to democratize single-cell metabolomics.</p><p><br></p><p>All MALDI-imaging MS data as well as metabolite and lipid annotations and images are publicly available through METASPACE (<a href='https://metaspace2020.eu/project/Rappez_2021_SpaceM' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://metaspace2020.eu/project/Rappez_2021_SpaceM</a>)</p>",single cell; coculture; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Hepatocytes; segmentation; light microscopy; Image Registration; untargeted metabolites; tandem mass spectrometry; MetaSpace,single cell; coculture; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Hepatocytes; segmentation; light microscopy; Image Registration; untargeted metabolites; tandem mass spectrometry; MetaSpace,SpaceM reveals metabolic states of single cells. 10.1038/s41592-021-01198-0.

The cells were then vortexed for 60 s, ultrasonicated for 30 min at 4 C twice and then kept at -20 C for 1 h to precipitate protein. The solution was centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 20 min at 4 C, and then the supernatant was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at -80 C until future use. The samples were re-dissolved in 100 muL acetonitrile:water (1:1, v/v) solvent and adequately vortexed, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 20 min at 4 C to obtain the supernatants for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis.</p>","<p>BMECs cell samples were separated on an UHPLC (Vanquish UHPLC, Thermo) coupled to a Orbitrap in Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd. Samples were analyzed using a 2.1 mm x 100 mm ACQUIY UPLC BEH Amide 1.7 m column (waters, Ireland). In both ESI positive and negative modes, the mobile phase contained A = 25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonium hydroxide in water and B = acetonitrile. The gradient was 98% B for 1.5 min and was linearly reduced to 2% in 10.5 min, and then kept for 2 min, and then increased to 98% in 0.1 min, with a 3 min re-equilibration period employed. In order to avoid the effects of instrument detection signal fluctuations, continuous analysis of samples was performed randomly. Pooled quality control (QC) samples (generated by taking an equal aliquot of all the samples included in the experiment) were run 3x times before the beginning of the sample queue for column conditioning and every 6 injections thereafter to assess inconsistencies that are particularly evident in large batch acquisitions in terms of retention time drifts and variation in ion intensity over time.</p>","<p>Electrospray ionization (ESI) positive and negative ion modes were used for detection in non-targeted metabolomics. The sample was separated by UHPLC and subjected to mass spectrometry using a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The ESI source conditions after HILIC chromatographic separation were as follows: ion source gas 1 (gas 1: nitrogen), 60; ion source gas 2 (gas 2: nitrogen), 60; curtain gas, 30 psi; source temperature, 600 C; ion spray voltage floating,  5500 V (positive and negative modes). In MS only acquisition, the instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 80-1200 Da,&nbsp;the resolution was set at 60000 and the accumulation time was set at 100 ms. In auto MS/MS acquisition, the instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 70-1200 Da, the resolution was set at 30000 and the accumulation time was set at 50 ms, exclude time within 4 s.</p>","<p>Non-targeted LC-MS/MS vendor raw data files were converted to the open source format mzML using the program ProteoWizard<strong>[1]</strong>, and then the XCMS program was used for peak alignment, retention time correction and peak area extraction<strong>[2]</strong>. For peak picking, the following parameters were used: centWave, m/z = 25 ppm, peakwidth = c(10,60), prefilter = c(10,100). For peak grouping, bw = 5, mzwid = 0.025, minfrac = 0.5 were used. In the extracted ion features, only the variables having more than 50% of the nonzero measurement values in at least one group were kept. Compound identification of metabolites was performed by MS/MS spectra with an in-house database established with available authentic standards. After normalized to total peak intensity, the processed data were uploaded into SIMCA-P (version 14.1, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden), where it was subjected to multivariate data analysis, including Pareto-scaled principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The 7-fold cross-validation and response permutation testing were used to evaluate the robustness of the model. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) value of each variable in the OPLS-DA model was calculated to indicate its contribution to the classification. Significance was determined using an unpaired Students t test. VIP value &gt; 1 and p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kessner D, Chambers M, Burke R, Agus D, Mallick P.

MTBLS1024,"Organic sulfur: a spatially variable, labile, and understudied component of marine organic matter","<p>Sulfur (S) is a major heteroatom in organic matter. This project evaluated spatial variability in the concentration and molecular-level composition of organic sulfur along gradients of depth and latitude. We measured the concentration of total organic sulfur (TOS) directly from whole seawater. Our data reveal high variability in organic sulfur, relative to established variability in total organic carbon or nitrogen. The deep ocean contained significant amounts of organic sulfur, and the concentration of TOS in North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) decreased with increasing age while total organic carbon remained stable. Analysis of dissolved organic matter extracts by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed that 6% of elemental formulas contained sulfur. The sulfur-containing compounds were structurally diverse, and showed higher numbers of sulfur-containing elemental formulas as NADW moved southward. These measurements of organic sulfur in seawater provide the foundation needed to define the factors controlling organic sulfur in the global ocean.</p>",untargeted metabolites; Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; sulfur molecular entity; North Atlantic Ocean,untargeted metabolites; Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; sulfur molecular entity; North Atlantic Ocean,"Organic sulfur: a spatially variable, labile, and understudied component of marine organic matter.",,,"Seawater samples were collected in April and May 2013 from multiple stations in the western Atlantic Ocean.

MilliQ water, processed and analyzed in the same manner as the samples, indicated low overlap between the blanks and the samples. Samples were infused into the ESI interface at 4 mul/min, and instrument and spray parameters were optimized for each sample. The capillary temperature was set at 250 C, and the spray voltage was between 3.7 and 4 kV. At least 200 scans were collected for each sample which is a sufficient number of scans for good peak reproducibility[1]. The mass range for the full-scan collection was 200 &lt; m/z &lt; 1000. Weekly mass calibrations were performed with an external standard (Thermo Calibration Mix) which results in mass accuracy errors &lt; 1.5 ppm. The processed spectra are internally calibrated following the guidelines previously described[2] which resulted in a mass accuracy &lt; 1 ppm.

MTBLS366,Using network analysis to discern compositional patterns in ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry data of dissolved organic matter,"<p><strong>RATIONALE: </strong>Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) has long been recognized as a large and dynamic component of the global carbon cycle. Yet, DOM is chemically varied and complex and these attributes present challenges to researchers interested in addressing questions about the role of DOM in global biogeochemical cycles.</p><p><strong>METHODS: </strong>Organic matter extracts from seawater were analyzed by direct infusion with electrospray ionization into a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Network analysis was used to quantify the number of chemical transformations between mass-to-charge values in each sample. The network of chemical transformations was calculated using the MetaNetter plug-in within Cytoscape. The chemical transformations serve as markers for the shared structural characteristics of compounds within complex DOM.</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Network analysis revealed that transformations involving selected sulfur-containing moieties and isomers of amino acids were more prevalent in the deep sea than in the surface ocean. Common chemical transformations were not significantly different between the deep sea and surface ocean. Network analysis complements existing computational tools used to analyze ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry data.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>This combination of ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry with novel computational tools has identified new potential building blocks of organic compounds in the deep sea, including the unexpected importance of dissolved organic sulfur components.

MTBLS4987,Global metabolomics of fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) explore metabolic adaptation to fresh water in insects,"<p>Aquatic insects are well-adapted to freshwater environments, but metabolic mechanisms of such adaptations, particularly to primary environmental factors (e.g., hypoxia, water pressure, dark light and abundant microbes), are poorly known. Most firefly species (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) are terrestrial, but the larvae of a few species are aquatic. We generated 24 global metabolomic profiles of larvae and adults of <em>Aquatica leii</em> (freshwater) and <em>Lychnuris praetexta</em> (terrestrial) to identify freshwater adaptation-related metabolites (AARMs). We identified 110 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in <em>A. leii</em> (adults vs aquatic larvae) and 183 DAMs in <em>L. praetexta</em> (adults vs terrestrial larvae). Furthermore, 100 DAMs specific to aquatic <em>A. leii</em> larvae were screened as AARMs via interspecific comparisons (<em>A. leii</em> vs <em>L. praetexta</em>), which were primarily involved in antioxidant activity, immune response, energy production and metabolism, and chitin biosynthesis. They were assigned to six categories/superclasses (e.g., lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, and organoheterocyclic compound). Finally, ten metabolic pathways shared between KEGG terms specific to aquatic fireflies and enriched by AARMs were screened as aquatic adaptation-related pathways (AARPs). These AARPs were primarily involved in energy metabolism, xenobiotic biodegradation, protection of oxidative/immune damage, oxidative stress response and sense function (e.g., glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 and taste transduction), and certain aspects of morphology (e.g., steroid hormone biosynthesis). These results provide evidence suggesting that abundance changes in metabolomes contribute to freshwater adaptation of fireflies.

The software generated a data matrix for the raw data, including sample information, retention time (RT), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values and peak intensity. Metabolic features that were detected at least in 70% of samples were retained. After filtering, minimum metabolite values were assessed for samples in which the metabolite levels fell below the lower limit of quantitation.

To detect reliable <strong>KEGG</strong> pathways specifically involved in freshwater adaptation of larval <em>A. leii</em>, 2 methods (i.e., DAM-KEGG-intersection and AARM-KEGG) were used, as previously described<strong>[3]</strong>. In the DAM-KEGG-intersection method DAMs of <em>L. praetexta</em> and <em>A. leii</em> were subjected to <strong>KEGG</strong> enrichment analysis, their results were intersected and the pathways specific to <em>A. leii</em> were obtained.

PMID:18085752.</p>","<p>The UHPLC-MS/MS raw data underwent comprehensive analysis through Compound Discoverer 3.1 developed by Thermo Fisher, which executed peak alignment, peak picking and quantitation of individual metabolites. Critical parameters encompassed a retention duration tolerance of 0.2 min, actual mass tolerance of 5 ppm, signal intensity tolerance of 30%, signal-to-noise ratio of 3, and a minimum intensity threshold of 100,000. It was attempted to normalize peak intensities to the total spectral intensity, and this normalized value was employed for predicting the molecular formula by amalgamating information from additive ions, molecular ion peaks, and fragment ions. Thereafter, the peaks were meticulously matched against the mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org/), mzVault and MassList databases. Compounds exhibiting a coefficient of variation (CV) exceeding 30% in the relative peak area within quality control, abbreviated as QC, samples were accurately excluded, ultimately resulting in the identification and relative quantification of metabolites. The subsequent statistical analyses were undertaken through R 4.3.1 and Python 3.11.4 software.</p>","<p>The peaks were meticulously matched against the mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org/), mzVault and MassList databases.</p>",MTBLC72665;

MTBLS1219,Impact of the used solvent on the reconstitution efficiency of evaporated biosamples for untargeted metabolomics studies,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Untargeted metabolomics intends to objectively analyze a wide variety of compounds. Their diverse physicochemical properties make it difficult to choose an appropriate reconstitution solvent after sample evaporation without influencing the chromatography or hamper column sorbent integrity.<h4>Objectives</h4>The study aimed to identify the most appropriate reconstitution solvent for blood plasma samples in terms of feature recovery, four endogenous compounds, and one selected internal standard.<h4>Methods</h4>We investigated several reconstitution solvent mixtures containing acetonitrile and methanol to resolve human plasma extract and evaluated them concerning the peak areas of tryptophan-d<sub>5</sub>, glucose, creatinine, palmitic acid, and the phophatidylcholine PC(P-16:0/P-16:0), as well as the total feature count RESULTS: Results indicated that acetonitrile containing 30% methanol was best suited to match all tested criteria at least for human blood plasma samples.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite identifying the mixture of acetonitrile and methanol being suitable as solvent for human blood plasma extracts, we recommend to systematically test for an appropriate reconstitution solvent for each analyzed biomatrix.",reconstitution method; untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; Recovery,reconstitution method; untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; Recovery,Impact of the used solvent on the reconstitution efficiency of evaporated biosamples for untargeted metabolomics studies. 10.1007/s11306-019-1631-1. PMID:32124055,,,Pooled plasma samples (stabilized by citrate) were obtained from a regional blood bank.,"For each mixture of reconstitution solvents, 100 L of pooled human plasma samples were transferred into a reaction tube and precipitated using 400 L of a mixture of methanol and ethanol (1:1, v/v) as recommended elsewhere (Bruce, Tavazzi, Parisod, Rezzi, Kochhar, Guy 2009). The mixture contained 50 mol tryptophan-d5 as internal standard. These samples were shaken for 2 min at 2000 rpm and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 15.000 rpm and 2C. 400 L of the supernatant were transferred into a new reaction tube and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge at 1400 rpm and room temperature. The obtained residues were reconstituted in different mixtures of acetonitrile and methanol containing 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% methanol. Each sample was prepared in triplicates. QC samples were obtained by reconstituting in eluent A and B (1:1, v/v) for analyses using a phenylhexyl column or eluent C and D (1:1, v/v) for analyses using HILIC. Five of these QC samples were prepared of each analysis. At last, a 1-L aliquot was injected into the LC-HRMS/MS system.","The analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TF, Dreieich, Germany) Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS pump consisting of a degasser, a quaternary pump, and an UltiMate autosampler. The performance of the column and the mass spectrometer was tested using a test mixture in prior to every experiment. Gradient reversed phase elution was performed on a TF Accucore PhenylHexyl column (100 mm  2.1 mm, 2.6 m) or a normal phase Macherey-Nagel (Dren, Germany) HILIC Nucleodur column (125  3 mm, 3 mum). The mobile phases for gradient elution using the PhenylHexyl column consisted of 2 mM aqueous ammonium formate containing acetonitrile (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, pH 3, eluent A), as well as 2mM ammonium formate solution with acetonitrile:methanol (1:1, v/v) containing water (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, eluent B). The flow rate was set from 0-10 min to 500 L/min and from 10-13.5 min to 800 L/min using the following gradient: 0-1.0 min 99% A, 1-10 min to 1% A, 10-11.5 min hold 1% A, 11.5-13.5 min hold 99% A. The gradient elution using the HILIC column was performed using aqueous ammonium acetate (200 mM, eluent C) and acetonitrile containing formic acid (0.1% , v/v, eluent D). The flow rate was set to 500 L/min using the following gradient: 0-1 min 2% C, 1-5 min 20% C, 5-8.5 min 60% C, 8.5-10 min hold 60% C. 10-12 min hold 2% C. For preparation and cleaning of the injection system isopropanol:water (90:10, v/v) was used. The following settings were used: wash volume, 100 L; wash speed, 4000 nL/s; loop wash factor, 2. Every analysis was performed at 40C column temperature, maintained by a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS analytical column heater. The injection volume for every analysis was 1 L..The analysis was performed using a randomized sequence order with five injections of pure methanol (PhenylHexyl column) or eluent D (HILIC column) samples at the beginning of the sequence for apparatus equilibration.","The analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TF, Dreieich, Germany) Q-Exactive Plus system equipped with a heated electrospray ionization HESI-II source. Mass calibration was done prior to analysis according to the manufacturers recommendations using external mass calibration. Additionally before each experiment the apparatus spray shield and capillary was cleaned. The HESI-II source conditions for every experiment were as follows: ionization mode, positive or negative; sheath gas, 60 AU; auxiliary gas, 10 AU; sweep gas, 3 AU; spray voltage, 3.50 kV in positive mode and -4.0 kV in negative mode; heater temperature, 320C; ion transfer capillary temperature, 320C; and S-lens RF level, 50.0. Mass spectrometry was performed according to a previously optimized workflow using full scan (FS) only. The settings for FS data acquisition were as follows: resolution, 140,000 fwhm; microscans, 1; automatic gain control (AGC) target, 5 105; maximum injection time, 200 ms; scan range, m/z 50-750; polarity, negative or positive; spectrum data type, centroid.","<p>Thermo Fisher LC-HRMS/MS <strong>RAW </strong>files were converted into <strong>mzXML </strong>files using<strong> Proteo Wizard[1]</strong>.

MTBLS1558,Lipid Profiles of Human Brain Tumors Obtained by High-Resolution Negative Mode Ambient Mass Spectrometry,"<p>Alterations in cell metabolism, including changes in lipid composition occurring during malignancy, are well characterized for various tumor types. However, a significant part of studies that deal with brain tumors have been performed using cell cultures and animal models. Here, we present a dataset of 124 high-resolution negative ionization mode lipid profiles of human brain tumors resected during neurosurgery. The dataset is supplemented with 38 non-tumor pathological brain tissue samples resected during elective surgery. The change in lipid composition alterations of brain tumors enables the possibility of discriminating between malignant and healthy tissues with the implementation of ambient mass spectrometry. On the other hand, the collection of clinical samples allows the comparison of the metabolism alteration patterns in animal models or in vitro models with natural tumor samples ex vivo. The presented dataset is intended to be a data sample for bioinformaticians to test various data analysis techniques with ambient mass spectrometry profiles, or to be a source of clinically relevant data for lipidomic research in oncology.</p>",Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; Brain Tumor Surgery; untargeted metabolites; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; spray-from-tissue ionization; Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry,Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; Brain Tumor Surgery; untargeted metabolites; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; spray-from-tissue ionization; Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry,Lipid Profiles of Human Brain Tumors Obtained by High-Resolution Negative Mode Ambient Mass Spectrometry. 10.3390/data6120132.,,,"<p>Samples were provided by the N.N.

MTBLS1750,Prokaryotic viperins produce diverse antiviral molecules,"Viperin is an interferon-induced cellular protein conserved in animals. It was shown to inhibit the replication of multiple viruses by producing a ribonucleotide called 3-deoxy-34-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), which acts as a chain terminator for the viral RNA polymerase. Here we show that the eukaryotic viperin has originated from a clade of bacterial and archaeal proteins that protect against phage infection. Prokaryotic viperins (pVips) produce a set of modified ribonucleotides that include, in addition to ddhCTP, also ddhGTP and ddhUTP. We further provide evidence that pVips protect against T7 phage infection by inhibiting viral polymerase-dependent transcription, suggesting a conserved mechanism of action shared between pVips and the animal viperin. Our results unveil a potential repository of natural antiviral compounds produced by bacterial immune systems.",RADICAL S-ADENOSYL METHIONINE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; targeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,RADICAL S-ADENOSYL METHIONINE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; targeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,Prokaryotic viperins produce diverse antiviral molecules.,,,"<p>Overnight cultures of Keio deltaiscR encoding pVips, the human viperin, MoaA and GFP negative controls were diluted 1:100 in 100 ml LB medium and grown at 37 C (250 rpm) for 1 hr 45 min.

MTBLS1876,A combined direct infusion/reversed phase chromatography  high resolution mass spectrometry workflow for accurate absolute lipid quantification with 13C- internal standards,"We propose a fully automated novel workflow for lipidomics based on flow injection, followed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (FI/LC-HRMS). The workflow combined in-depth characterization of the lipidome achieved via reversed-phase LC-HRMS with absolute quantification by using a large number of lipid species-specific and/or retention time (RT)-matched/class-specific calibrants. The lipidome of 13C-labelled yeast (LILY) provided a large panel of cost-effective internal standards (ISTDs) covering triacylglycerols (TG), steryl esters (SE), free fatty acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DG), sterols (ST), ceramides (Cer), hexosyl ceramides (HexCer), phosphatidylglycerols (PG), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), phosphatidic acids (PA), cardiolipins (CL), phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylserines (PS), phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPE). The workflow in combination with the LILY lipid panel enables simultaneous quantification via (1) external multi-point calibration with internal standardization and (2) internal one-point calibration with LILY as a surrogate ISTD, increasing the coverage while keeping the accuracy and throughput high. Extensive measures on quality control allowed us to rank the calibration strategies and to automatically select the calibration strategy of the highest metrological order for the respective lipid species. Overall, the workflow enabled a streamlined analysis, with a limit of detection in the low femtomolar range, and provided validation tools together with absolute concentration values for >350 lipids in human plasma on a species level. Based on the selected standard panel, lipids from 7 classes (LPC, LPE, PC, PE, PI, DG, TG) passed stringent quality filters, which included QC accuracy, a precision and recovery bias of <30% and concentrations within the 99% confidence interval of the international laboratory comparison of SRM 1950, NIST, USA. The quantitative values are independent of common deuterated or non-endogenous ISTDs, thus offering cross-validation of different lipid methods and further standardizing lipidomics.",Lipidomics; absolute quantification; standardization; flow injection analysis-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; isotopic tracer; Calibration; targeted metabolites; tandem mass spectrometry,Lipidomics; absolute quantification; standardization; flow injection analysis-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; isotopic tracer; Calibration; targeted metabolites; tandem mass spectrometry,A combined flow injection/reversed-phase chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry workflow for accurate absolute lipid quantification with <sup>13</sup>C internal standards. 10.1039/d0an02443k.

In the first step, calibrants from the RP-LC data were used to produce a multipoint calibration curve without the use of internal standards. With these calibration curves, accuracy and precision of the QCs was calculated and incorrect substances were removed as ESTD to avoid the use of incorrect ESTD. If concentration of QCs was met, these ESTD were further used for internal standardized quantification as well as the calculation of the final sample concentrations for lipids, where LILY cannot offer a labeled ISTD (e.g. AcCa, SM and Hex2Cer) [termed: ESTD only]. In general, multipoint calibrations were always performed by selecting the 6 closest calibration levels for each analyte area. This was also the case for the internal standardized multipoint calibration for all ESTD matched with the closest ISTD by RT [termed: Multipoint]. For an easier nomenclature, the 3 levels definition of the <strong>Lipidomics Standard Initiative </strong>(<strong>LSI</strong>) (see <strong>publication supplementary</strong> in the paper associated with this study) was used for ESTD and ISTD and only Level 1 or 2 were selected here. By quantifying the LILY lipids intra-daily via DI-HRMS and RP-LC-HRMS, all ISTD can be used for RT-matched internal standardized 1-point calibration avoiding level 3 standards to quantify all other analytes. LILY was quantified via multipoint calibration via DI-HRMS data [termed: DI-RP 1-point] or via RP-LC-HRMS data [termed: RP 1-point] if it co-elutes with an ESTD in RP-LC or was not detected in DI-HRMS.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref</strong>:</p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Triebl A, Burla B, Selvalatchmanan J, Oh J, Tan SH, Chan MY, Mellet NA, Meikle PJ, Torta F, Wenk MR.

MTBLS2960,Spatial metabolomics shows contrasting phosphonolipid distributions in tissues of marine bivalves,"<p>Lipids are an integral part of cellular membranes, vary between species, and allow cells to alter stiffness, permeability and curvature. Among lipids, phosphonolipids uniquely contain a phosphonate bond between carbon and phosphorous. Despite this distinctive biochemical characteristic, few models explore the biological role of phosphonolipids. A protective function has been inferred based on chemical and biological stability. The function of a tissue ultimately depends on its chemical makeup. Thus if the function of a tissue is known, for example, the barrier function of exposed epithelial cells, the function of an associated metabolite can be inferred. To investigate possible functions of phosphonolipids we analyzed two species of marine mollusks, the blue mussel <em>Mytilus edulis</em> and pacific oyster <em>Crassostrea gigas</em>, and determined the diversity of phosphonolipids and their distribution in different organs. High resolution spatial metabolomics revealed that the lipidome varies significantly between tissues within one organ. Despite their chemical similarity, the heterogeneity of the phosphonolipids within the lipid landscape likely reflects a functional diversity of the tissue. While some phosphonolipids are ubiquitously distributed, others are present almost exclusively in the ciliated epithelial cells. The exclusive localization of certain phosphonolipids in tissues exposed to the environment supports the hypothesis of a protective function in mollusks. This study highlights that the tissue specific distribution of an individual metabolite can be a valuable tool in inferring its function.</p>",Lipidomics; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; phosphonolipid; MetaSpace,Lipidomics; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; phosphonolipid; MetaSpace,Spatial metabolomics shows contrasting phosphonolipid distributions in tissues of marine bivalves.,,,"<p>Live <strong><em>Mytilus edulis</em></strong> (<em>M. edulis</em>) and <strong><em>Crassostrea gigas</em></strong> (<em>C. gigas</em>) were purchased at a local store as live animals. <em>M. edulis</em> came from the North Sea, <em>C. gigas</em> came from France, farmed in the basin of Marennes-Oleron.

MTBLS413,Metabolomics identifies multiple candidate biomarkers to diagnose and stage human African trypanosomiasis,"Treatment for human African trypanosomiasis is dependent on the species of trypanosome causing the disease and the stage of the disease (stage 1 defined by parasites being present in blood and lymphatics whilst for stage 2, parasites are found beyond the blood-brain barrier in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Currently, staging relies upon detecting the very low number of parasites or elevated white blood cell numbers in CSF. Improved staging is desirable, as is the elimination of the need for lumbar puncture. Here we use metabolomics to probe samples of CSF, plasma and urine from 40 Angolan patients infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, at different disease stages. Urine samples provided no robust markers indicative of infection or stage of infection due to inherent variability in urine concentrations. Biomarkers in CSF were able to distinguish patients at stage 1 or advanced stage 2 with absolute specificity. Eleven metabolites clearly distinguished the stage in most patients and two of these (neopterin and 5-hydroxytryptophan) showed 100% specificity and sensitivity between our stage 1 and advanced stage 2 samples. Neopterin is an inflammatory biomarker previously shown in CSF of stage 2 but not stage 1 patients. 5-hydroxytryptophan is an important metabolite in the serotonin synthetic pathway, the key pathway in determining somnolence, thus offering a possible link to the eponymous symptoms of sleeping sickness. Plasma also yielded several biomarkers clearly indicative of the presence (87% sensitivity and 95% specificity) and stage of disease (92% sensitivity and 81% specificity). A logistic regression model including these metabolites showed clear separation of patients being either at stage 1 or advanced stage 2 or indeed diseased (both stages) versus control.",human african trypanosomiasis; Trypanosoma brucei; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; infectious disease biomarker; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics,human african trypanosomiasis; Trypanosoma brucei; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; infectious disease biomarker; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics,Metabolomics identifies multiple candidate biomarkers to diagnose and stage human African trypanosomiasis. 10.1371/jourl.pntd.0005140. PMID:27941966,,,"Samples were obtained retrospectively from a clinical study conducted in Angola between 2008 and 2011. This study aimed to collect appropriate clinical, neurological, psychiatric and biological data from a cohort of 236 T. b. gambiense infected patients followed up prospectively from diagnosis to end of follow-up, and controls. Controls and patients were enrolled during both active and passive screening activities by teams of the national sleeping sickness control program. The reference screening test at that time was the CATT followed by confirmation using microscopy, with concentration methods for blood/CSF. Cases of HAT were defined as subjects in whom trypanosomes were demonstrated either in blood, lymph node aspirate or CSF by microscopy. Cases were classified as stage 1 when no trypanosomes were observed in CSF and when the CSF white blood cell count (WBC) was lower than or equal to 5 WBC/l, while those with trypanosomes in CSF and/or a CSF WBC count above 20 WBC/l were classified as advanced stage 2. Controls were subjects living in the same areas as cases, with no previous history of HAT treatment and who were seropositive (positive with 1 or more serological tests) but with no detectable parasites in any body fluid.</p>Samples, which were collected in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were stored in liquid nitrogen before being transported to Limoges on dry ice, then stored at -80 C. Although the significant time lapse between collection and metabolomics analysis could lead to storage related effects on the samples, all samples were treated equally, hence comparisons between samples may be considered robust. The identification of metabolites such as neopterin, behaving as previously demonstrated in targeted analysis corroborated this. A lymph node aspirate was taken from any subject who presented with swollen lymph nodes and examined for trypanosomes by microscopy. 10 ml venous blood with heparin as anticoagulant was collected from CATT positive subject, as well as from lymph node positive patients. 600 l of blood was used to perform the capillary tube centrifugation test (4 capillary tubes of 75 l) and the miniature anion exchange centrifugation technique (300 l). For subjects who were positive by CATT on whole blood, 1 ml plasma was used to perform CATT dilutions. Parasitologically confirmed cases and/or subjects found positive by CATT at a dilution of 1/16 who were negative by all other parasitological methods that were performed underwent a lumbar puncture, in accordance with national guidelines for stage determination and/or parasitological confirmation in CSF, when there were suggestive neurological signs. Parasitological examination of CSF was done using the modified single centrifugation technique. This optimised parasitological confirmation method permits sensitivity or parasite detection similar to molecular testing. All plasma, buffy coat and CSF samples that remained after the diagnostic procedures were aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. Patient medical data were anonymised.","Metabolite extractions were performed as per standard procedures in January-March 2015 (after between 5 and 7 years in storage). Samples were checked for metabolite degradation and all passed. Briefly, 5 l of sample was extracted in 200 l of UPLC grade chloroform:methanol:water (1:3:1) on ice. Samples were centrifuged and stored at -80 C before being run through the LC-MS system.","The injection volume was 10 l and samples were maintained at 5 C prior to injection.

Animals were housed in ventilated cages with males and females kept separate, two animals per cage (social housing) and unlimited access to chow and water.

Mini pig (Gottingen minipig (Ellegaard, Denmark)) was sacrificed at 18 months of age under anesthesia (mixture of Zoletil, xylazine, buthorphanol and ketamine), the intestine removed, flushed with saline, frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 C until sectioning and analysis.",,,"MSI</br>All MSI experiments were performed using an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a reduced-pressure MALDI ion source incorporating a dual-ion funnel interface (Spectroglyph LLC, Kennewick, WA, USA) as recently described [1]. For MALDI-MSI, the system was equipped with a Q-switched frequency tripled Nd:YLF laser emitting 349-nm light (Explorer One, Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA, USA). The laser was operated at a repetition rate of 1 kHz and pulse energy of ~1.2 J as measured by the internal photodiode prior to any external optics. The laser was focused to a spot ~15 m in diameter as measured by burn patterns in deposited matrix. The sample region and the entrance to the high pressure ion funnel were maintained at a pressure of 10.0 mbar while the exit of the second, low-pressure ion funnel was maintained at 2.0 mbar. Radiofrequency voltages of 620 kHz, 125 V0-peak and 990 kHz, 80 V0-peak were applied to the high- and low-pressure ion funnels, respectively. Extraction of MALDI-generated ions from the slide into the ion funnels was accomplished by an electric field gradient of ~100 V/cm between the sample holder and the first ion funnel electrode. MALDI stage motion was synchronised with ion accumulation using the LTQ trigger signal indicating commencement of the ion trap injection event. In this way, synchronisation with any MSn event is possible. This trigger signal is accessed via pin 14 of the LTQ J1 connector and is activated by setting the injection period value to 0 in the Tune Plus software (DiagnosticsTriggersInjection Period0).The mass spectrometer was operated using an ion injection time of 250 ms and automatic gain control turned off. FTMS mass resolution was set to the maximum value of 240,000 (FWHM @ m/z 400) while the linear ion trap was operated at the normal scan speed. All IT-MS/MS spectra were acquired in parallel to the 768 ms Orbitrap transient using collision-induced dissociation with a normalised collision energy of 30 and 40 for the positive- and negative-ion mode, respectively. As performing MS/MS in a linear ion trap results in an inability to trap fragments below a certain m/z value relative to the selected precursor ion, certain diagnostic fragments may not be observed (the so-called low-mass cutoff). The lowest m/z fragment that can be detected upon mass selection and resonant activation is dependent on the qz value of the ion which in turn is dependent on the voltages applied to the electrodes, the mass and charge of the ion and the geometry of the ion trap. Under typical operating conditions with a qz value of 0.25 for the ion to be fragmented, fragment ions having m/z values approximately less than one third that of the precursor have unstable trajectories and are thus not detected. Practically for lipids this means the diagnostic m/z 184 ion characteristic of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin lipids is often not observed. To overcome this limitation in positive-ion mode the activation qz was lowered from the default value of 0.25 to 0.17 in the Tune Plus software to enable detection of the m/z 184 fragment ion.</br>For all MSI experiments, a stage step size of 20 m (horizontal)  40 m (vertical) was used. Parallel full-scan FTMS (Orbitrap) and IT-MS/MS (ion trap) scans at adjacent 20-m positions were accomplished using an instrument method consisting of two repeating scan events. The first was a 240,000 resolution FTMS scan from m/z 1802000. The second was DDA IT-MS/MS, key details of which are summarised in Table 1 of the associated paper [2]. In this way, one full scan FTMS and one IT-MS/MS scan were acquired from each 40  40 m sampling region, which is also the pixel size of the MSI data. Both full-scan FTMS and DDA-IT-MS/MS scans were completed at the same time, a key synchronization component of this method. As a result, IT-MS/MS acquisition did not add any extra time to data acquisitions. To compare IT-MS/MS sensitivity between FTMS analysis and ion trap fragment detection, one cerebellum section was analysed using identical conditions with the exception that product ions were sequentially analysed in the Orbitrap with a nominal mass resolution of 240,000 (FWHM at m/z 400).</br></br>MS/MS</br>Validation of molecular lipid species identified using IT-MS/MS with high mass resolution FT-MS/MS</br>To validate molecular lipid assignments based on IT-MS/MS data, high resolution MS/MS data was acquired under identical ion activation conditions. To accumulate high numbers of precursor ions for sensitive detection of fragments, a 5000-ms ion injection time was used while the sample stage was continuously moved across the cerebellum at 1 mm/s. Each m/z value that was assigned to a molecular lipid species (Supplementary Table 1 [2]) was analyzed by this approach. Data was collected for each precursor for 5 min (negative-ion mode) and 4 min (positive-ion mode), resulting in 20 and ~25 respective scans collected, when accounting for stage flyback time (also fixed at 1 mm/s). To validate molecular lipid identifications, only fragments resulting from the direct neutral loss of FA chains from the [M+H]+ or [M-H]- precursors were considered as only these can be unambiguously assigned to individual precursors using the high mass resolution and accuracy (all molecular lipid species identifications in positive mode utilized the [M+H]+ ions). This ability to assign individual fragment ions to specific precursors arises as isobaric fragments ions are readily resolved (e.g. a 16:0 neutral loss arising from two isobaric precursors) and this enables one to confidently attribute a particular FA neutral loss to a specific and accurate m/z value. It thus provides unambiguous confirmation that a certain FA is present in a given precursor lipid from which it is generated. For each FA chain (excluding ether-linked chains), two fragments are possible corresponding to its loss as a either neutral fatty acid (FA(+HO)) and ketene (FA(-H)). An identification was validated only when all fragments were observed within 2 ppm of the theoretical fragment mass and at least two of the possible four fragments with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3 were detected. Signal and noise values were taken directly from the Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser while fragment m/z values were manually collected from the online ALEX123 library (http://alex123.info/ALEX123/MS2.php). Some exceptions to this process were as follows:</br>1. For phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids that did not produce the fragments described above, the class identifying fragment resulting from loss of the serine headgroup (-87 Da) and the sequential loss of the headgroup and FAs as either a neutral acid or ketene were used. PS lipids were thus validated following detection of the -87 Da fragment ions and two or more fragments resulting from sequential losses of 87 Da and FA chains. As above, all validating fragments were within 2 ppm of their calculated m/z value.</br>2. For lyso phosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), lyso phosphatidylcholine (LPC), lyso phosphatidylinositol (LPI) and lyso phosphatidic acid (LPA) only the neutral loss of the single FA as a ketene was observed, and this was used as the validating fragment when within 2 ppm of the calculated fragment m/z value.</br>3. For sulfatides, only one molecular lipid fragment is utilized in ALEX123, which is indicative of the N-FA chain. This fragment was used for validation when detected within 2 ppm of the calculated fragment m/z value. Detection of this fragment then enabled the nature of the sphinganine/sphingosine moiety to be inferred.</br>4. For PE ethers (PE O-), due to the ambiguity arising when using fatty acyl neutral losses in negative-ion mode, only characteristic fragments from the [M+H]+ ions were used for validation (see Table 2 [2] for list of adduct ions used for full-scan FTMS and IT-MS/MS confirmation).</br></br>Note, for MS/MS files titled 'CID_MSMS_Validation', up to 10 different MSMS spectra are present in each raw data file, further information relating to this can be found in the study file section of this study; MSMSlist.xlsx .</br></br>Validation of lipids identified using IT-MS/MS of synthetic standards</br>Various lipid identifications were also validated by comparing fragmentation spectra obtained from DDA-imaging experiments to those of synthetic standards corresponding to ALEX123-identified lipids. This validation was performed for representative lipid species from six different lipid classes, namely PI16:0/16:0, PA16:0/18:1, PG16:0/18:1, PS16:0/18:1, PE16:0/18:1 and PC16:0/18:1. Lipid standards (purchased as chloroform solutions; Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA)) were first diluted to 100 M solutions in 2:1 CHCl3:MeOH (v/v). An aliquot of 10 l of each standard solution was further diluted in 990 l of matrix solution (7 mg/ml norharmane in 2:1 CHCl3:MeOH (v/v)) to give a final lipid concentrations of 1 M. This process was repeated separately for each standard. Each lipid:matrix solution (1 l) was then pipetted onto a blank ITO glass slide and analyzed by IT-MS/MS under the same fragmentation conditions used for DDA-imaging experiments (Table 1 [2]). IT-MS/MS data were acquired for 1 min from each standard and the average spectrum used for analysis. For PC, the corresponding [M+H]+ ions were chosen because they provide the MLFs used by ALEX123, whereas the [M-H]- ions were used for all other lipids. These data along with the corresponding IT-MS-MS data taken from each DDA-imaging replicate are provided in Supplementary Figure 7 [2]. The strong similarity between fragments generated from synthetic standards and those detected and used to make structural assignments validates both the assignments and the ALEX123 workflow. Small differences in peak ratios and the presence of additional peaks in the DDA-imaging data are due to the co-isolation and fragmentation of isobaric and isomeric ions. Importantly, isobaric ions were resolved during the full-scan FTMS analysis.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Belov ME, Ellis SR, Dilillo M, Paine MRL, Danielson WF, Anderson GA, de Graaf EL, Eijkel GB, Heeren RMA, McDonnell LA.

Thermo Fisher .raw data was first converted to profile mode mzXML format using RawConverter [1] (http://fields.scripps.edu/rawconv/). The mzXML file contains all scan header information identifying the scan type (full MS or MS/MS), scan number, mass analyser, and precursor ion mass for MS/MS scans. The DDA-imaging acquisition sequence results in every second scan being a full FTMS scan across each 40  40 m2 area of tissue, which is used for image reconstruction. Using the positioning file created by the MALDI control software that relates stage positons to scan numbers [2], each full MS could then be correlated with its acquisition position on the sample. After position assignment, the mean spectrum produced after m/z binning in 1.5 mDa increments was used for peak picking using the PEAPI algorithm [3]. The resulting peak list was then applied to each individual scan to produce the MSI dataset. Individual m/z images were then visualized using a MATLAB GUI. All images were generated following total ion current normalization, as is commonplace for MSI data.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] He L, Diedrich J, Chu Y-Y, Yates JR.

The ALEX123 framework uses a curated fragmentation database (based on MS/MS of synthetic lipid standards and features information for more than 430,000 lipid molecules) for searching mass spectral data and a dedicated algorithm for identifying lipid molecules at high confidence [1]. The ALEX123 framework is available for download at http://mslipidomics.infosoftware together with an example dataset and a user guide. Prior to lipid identification, all individual scan filters from each MSI experiment were averaged and saved as text files. Lipid species detected by FTMS were identified using an m/z tolerance of 2 ppm, a relative intensity threshold greater than 0.05% of the most intense lipid peak, corrected for potential 13C isotope interference25, and a frequency of three (equivalent to being detected in all three tissue replicates per each polarity). Lipid fragment ions detected by IT-MS/MS were identified using a m/z tolerance of 0.2, an absolute intensity threshold of greater than 0.05, and a frequency of three (equivalent to being detected in all three tissue replicates per each polarity). For high-confidence identification of sum-composition-level lipid species (e.g., PC(34:1)) detected by FTMS, at least one confirmatory LCF (lipid class fragment) detected by IT-MS/MS was required (see Supplementary Table 2 [2] for list of lipid adduct ions used for identification). For high-confidence identification of molecular lipid species identified by MLFs, the following criteria were set: i) the asymmetric molecular lipid species must be detected by at least two complementary pairs of MLFs (except for protonated PE O- species that do not release abundant complementary MLFs); ii) the molecular lipid species must have an ALEX123 score greater than 0.5 (calculated as the number of detected MLFs relative to the total number of MLFs available in the ALEX123 database), or an ALEX123 score 0.5 but with detection of more than 2 MLFs (with the exception that protonated PE O- species could be detected by at least 2 MLFs); and iii) confirmation by detection of sum-composition-level lipid species by FTMS (Table 2 [2]). We note that the molecular lipid species are annotated by molecular composition (e.g. PC16:0-18:1) where the positioning of FA moieties on the glycerol-phosphate backbone is undefined.

MTBLS1066,Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals Molecular Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Healthy and Tumor Xenograft Mouse Models,"The application of ketogenic diet (KD) (high fat/low carbohydrate/adequate protein) as an auxiliary cancer therapy is a field of growing attention. KD provides sufficient energy supply for healthy cells, while possibly impairing energy production in highly glycolytic tumor cells. Moreover, KD regulates insulin and tumor related growth factors (like insulin growth factor-1, IGF-1). In order to provide molecular evidence for the proposed additional inhibition of tumor growth when combining chemotherapy with KD, we applied untargeted quantitative metabolome analysis on a spontaneous breast cancer xenograft mouse model, using MDA-MB-468 cells. Healthy mice and mice bearing breast cancer xenografts and receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy were compared after treatment with control diet and KD. Metabolomic profiling was performed on plasma samples, applying high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis revealed metabolic fingerprints comprising numerous significantly regulated features in the group of mice bearing breast cancer. This fingerprint disappeared after treatment with KD, resulting in recovery to the metabolic status observed in healthy mice receiving control diet. Moreover, amino acid metabolism as well as fatty acid transport were found to be affected by both the tumor and the applied KD. Our results provide clear evidence of a significant molecular effect of adjuvant KD in the context of tumor growth inhibition and suggest additional mechanisms of tumor suppression beyond the proposed constrain in energy supply of tumor cells.",Ketogenic Diet; breast cancer; Xenograft; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Ketogenic Diet; breast cancer; Xenograft; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals Molecular Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Healthy and Tumor Xenograft Mouse Models. 10.3390/ijms20163873.

A quality control sample (pool) was generated by merging an aliquot (10 l) of all samples included in the study. Prior to injection into the UHPLC-MS system, samples and pools were diluted 1:5 with Millipore water for reversed phase mode and 1:3 with acetonitrile (VWR, Rednor, PA, USA) for HILIC mode separation.</p><p><br></p><p>Each sequence started with 3 blank runs, followed by 3 pool injections and finished with 1 pool and 1 blank run. In between, a blank run and a pool run were conducted after every third sample. Each sample was measured in 4 different selectivity and ionization mode combinations, which were RPpositive ionization, RPnegative ionization, HILICpositive ionization, and HILICnegative ionization, resulting in 4 data sets per study.

Apart from the run time of 13.0 min in RP mode and 30.0 min in HILIC mode, MS settings of the data-dependent Top 5 method were identical for both selectivity modes. Scan range and resolution of MS1 scans were set to 80850 m/z and 70,000, respectively, using an AGC target of 1 x 10^6 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The 5 most abundant ions of the MS1 scan were isolated with an isolation window of 0.8 m/z, fragmented via HCD applying stepped normalized collision energies of 20, 40, 60 and acquired in centroid mode. The maximum injection time was set to 64 ms with an AGC target of 5 x 10^4 at a resolution of 17,500. In addition to an exclusion of charges greater than 2, dynamic exclusion of 5.0 s was used, in order to avoid multiple fragmentations of the same ions. Using these settings, all samples were measured in the positive and negative ionization mode in separated sequences for each selectivity and ionization mode. Tune parameters were a capillary temperature of 320 C, a probe heater temperature of 350 C and an S-lens level of 50 for both ionization modes. Differing settings were a sprayer voltage of 4.0 and 3.5 kV, sheath gas flow rate of 35 and 45, as well as an auxiliary gas flow rate of 5 and 10 in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively.</p>","<p>Acquired raw files were converted to .mzML files using the MSConvert tool of the ProteoWizard software (version 3.0.8688).

Along that line, the HPLC-MS signals were aligned retention time wise, followed by exclusion of features that did not exceed a threshold of 5-fold the median intensity of the corresponding signal in the blank from further data processing. In the next step, data was normalized via a robust regression to account for variations occurring during sample preparation and measurement. Features showing instable signals in the quality control runs and those not being present in a sufficient number of replicates or treatment conditions were removed. Filtering was based on peak area threshold in blank runs, as well as on relative standard deviation in quality control samples and occurrence in biological replicates. </p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Berthold, M.R.; Cebron, N.; Dill, F.; Gabriel, T.R.; Ktter, T.; Meinl, T.; Ohl, P.; Thiel, K.; Wiswedel, B.

MTBLS1167,Untargeted metabolomics to understand the basis of phenotypic differences in amphotericin B-resistant Leishmania parasites,"<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Protozoan Leishmania parasites are responsible for a range of clinical infections that represent a substantial challenge for global health. Amphotericin B (AmB) is increasingly used to treat Leishmania infection, so understanding the potential for resistance to this drug is an important priority. Previously we described four independently-derived AmB-resistant L. mexicana lines that exhibited resistance-associated genetic lesions resulting in altered sterol content. However, substantial phenotypic variation between these lines, including differences in virulence attributes, were not fully explained by these changes.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> To identify alterations in cellular metabolism potentially related to phenotypic differences between wild-type and AmB-resistant lines, we extracted metabolites and performed untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> We observed substantial differences in metabolite abundance between lines, arising in an apparently stochastic manner. Concerted remodeling of central carbon metabolism was not observed; however, in three lines, decreased abundance of several oligohexoses was observed. Given that the oligomannose mannogen is an important virulence factor in Leishmania, this could relate to loss of virulence in these lines. Increased abundance of the reduced forms of the oxidative stress-protective thiols trypanothione and glutathione was also observed in multiple lines.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This dataset will provide a useful resource for understanding the molecular basis of drug resistance in Leishmania, and suggests a role for metabolic changes separate from the primary mechanism of drug resistance in determining the phenotypic profile of parasite lines subjected to experimental selection of resistance.</p>",amphotericin B; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Drug Resistance,amphotericin B; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Drug Resistance,Untargeted metabolomics to understand the basis of phenotypic differences in amphotericin B-resistant Leishmania parasites.,,,"<p>Derivation of AmB-resistant lines from parental Leishmania mexicana strain M379 was described previously[1].

Data were processed and peaks were identified using the Centwave function in the XCMS package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html). Data were grouped using mzMatch (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/) with a grouping retention time window of 0.5 min, and grouping m/z of 5 ppm. A relative standard deviation filter of 0.50 for pooled samples was applied, along with a noise filter of 0.80, an intensity filter of 1,000, a minimum number of detections threshold of 3 and a 0.10 min retention time window for related peaks.","<p>Initial metabolite identification from raw data, and relative quantification using peak area, were performed using the mzMatch package in R[1] and IDEOM software[2]. Putative metabolite identification corresponds for the most part to Metabolite Standards Initiative (MSI) level 2 (mass only), whereas metabolites matching in retention time to an included standard correspond to level 1, as indicated in Table 1[3], in the paper associated with this study. Peaks having an area with root squared deviation across pooled samples &gt; 50% were excluded, as were those with a retention time &lt; 4 min (due to poor resolution) those identified as peptides (due to poor reproducibility), and those not matched to a metabolite. Peaks were subjected to initial filtering in which poor quality peaks were manually removed (performed in a blinded fashion in which metabolite names were unknown). Data were then log-transformed (log10(intensity + 1)) and a one-way ANOVA test was performed, followed by a Tukeys Honest Significant Difference post hoc test to compare sample groups. A Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons procedure was used to adjust p-values from the initial ANOVA. All statistical analysis was performed in R, and plots were generated using ggplot2[4] and gplots[5] R packages.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Scheltema RA, Jankevics A, Jansen RC, Swertz MA, Breitling R.

MTBLS1801,Assessing the impact of nitrogen supplementation in oats across multiple growth locations and years with targeted phenotyping and high-resolution metabolite profiling approaches,"Oats (Avena sativa L.) are a healthy food, being high in dietary fibre (e.g. beta-glucans), antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins. Understanding the effect of variety and crop management on nutritional quality is important. The response of four oat varieties to increased nitrogen levels was investigated across multiple locations and years with respect to yield, grain quality and metabolites (assessed via GC- and LC- MS). A novel high-resolution UHPLC-PDA-MS/MS method was developed, providing improved metabolite enrichment, resolution, and identification. The combined phenotyping approach revealed that, amino acid levels were increased by nitrogen supplementation, as were total protein and nitrogen containing lipid levels, whereas health-beneficial avenanthramides were decreased. Although nitrogen addition significantly increased grain yield and beta-glucan content, supporting increasing the total nitrogen levels recommended within agricultural guidelines, oat varietal choice as well as negative impacts upon health beneficial secondary metabolites and the environmental burdens associated with nitrogen fertilisation, require further consideration.",untargeted metabolites; Plant metabolomics; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; nitrogen supplementation; grain quality; beta-D-glucan; Lipidomics; Avenanthramides,untargeted metabolites; Plant metabolomics; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; nitrogen supplementation; grain quality; beta-D-glucan; Lipidomics; Avenanthramides,Assessing the impact of nitrogen supplementation in oats across multiple growth locations and years with targeted phenotyping and high-resolution metabolite profiling approaches. 10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.129585. PMID:33799237,,,"<p>3 trials were conducted, the first at IBERS, Lydbury North, Shropshire, UK (latitude 52.45, longitude 2.94, sandy loam soil type) in 2014 (IBERS 2014), the second and third at ADAS Rosemaund, Herefordshire, UK (latitude 52.15, longitude 2.59, sandy clay loam soil type) in 2014 and 2015 (ADAS 2014 and ADAS 2015 respectively). The trials consisted of a split plot design with 3 replicates, using 5 (IBERS 2014) or 6 (ADAS 2014 and ADAS 2015) levels of nitrogen application (main plot treatment) and 4 commercially available winter oat varieties (sub-plot treatment). These included 2 of the most widely grown winter oat varieties in the UK over the last 20 years: Gerald and Mascani (AHDB, 2015). 3 varieties were of conventional height (Mascani, Gerald and Tardis) and the fourth was a dwarf variety (Balado). Plots (1.8 x 6 m) were sown on the 9th October 2013 (IBERS 2014), 30th September 2013 (ADAS 2014) and 1st October 2014 (ADAS 2015), at a sowing rate of 300 seeds/m^2 and harvested on the 7th August 2014 (IBERS 2014), 4th August 2014 (ADAS, 2014) and 8th August 2015 (ADAS 2015), using a small plot combine which incorporated a grain moisture analyser. Fungicides and weed control followed standard practise for winter oats. Soils were sampled to a depth of 90 cm in early spring and residual soil nitrogen was determined to be 96 kg N/ha (IBERS 2014), 22 and 24 kg N/ha (ADAS 2014 and ADAS 2015). Nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) doses were split between 3 different developmental stages in early to late spring to provide 5-6 final treatments (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). At the Lydbury North and ADAS Rosemaund 2014 trials, this consisted of level 1 control, no applied nitrogen; level 2, 50 kg N/ha applied; level 3, 100 kg N/ha applied; level 4, 150 kg N/ha applied; level 5, 200 kg N/ha applied; and level 6 (ADAS Rosemaund 2014 only), 250 kg N/ha applied. At the ADAS, Rosemaund 2015 trial, this consisted of level 1 control, no applied nitrogen; level 2, 60 kg N/ha applied; level 3, 120 kg N/ha applied; level 4, 180 kg N/ha applied; level 5, 230 kg N/ha applied; level 6, 280 kg N/ha applied (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Prior to harvest the number of fertile shoots (panicles) per m^2 were counted. Lodging (% plot area at greater than 45 from vertical) and leaning (% plot area at 10 to 45 from vertical) were assessed immediately prior to harvest at all sites. These data were used to calculate a lodging index on a 0100 scale: lodging index = % area lodged + (% area leaning)/2. A linear plus exponential model (George, 1984) was used to fit grain yield responses to N and the economically optimum N rate (Nopt) was determined assuming the breakeven price ratio to be 5:1 as per the England and Wales Fertiliser recommendations RB209, i.e. the crop yield (kg) needed to pay for 1 kg N.</p>","<p><strong>UPLC-MS:</strong></p><p>Groats were homogenised using a Retsch Cyclone Mill - Twister (12,000 rpm/min; 62 ms peripheral rotor speed; 1 mm sieve; 1 min cycle).

MTBLS2956,Untargeted metabolomics of purple and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes reveals a large structural diversity of anthocyanins and flavonoids,"<p>Anthocyanins are economically valuable phytochemicals of significant relevance to human health. Industrially extracted from multiple fruit and vegetable sources, anthocyanin yield and profiles can vary between sources and growing conditions. In this study, we focused on three purple-fleshed and one orange-fleshed cultivars of sweet potato, a warm-weather, nutritious crop of substantial interest to growers in northern, cooler latitudes, to determine the yield and diversity of anthocyanins and flavonoids. Acidified ethanol extraction of lyophilized roots yielded ~800&nbsp;mg average anthocyanins/100&nbsp;g dry weight from all three cultivars. UHPLC-DAD-Orbitrap analysis of sweet potato extracts identified 18 high-confidence, mostly acylated peonidin and cyanidin derivatives contributing to &gt;90% of the total anthocyanin signal. Further assessment of the untargeted Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry data using deep learning and molecular networking identified over 350 flavonoid peaks with variable distributions in different sweet potato cultivars. These results provide a novel insight into anthocyanin content of purple-fleshed sweet potatoes grown in the northern latitudes, and reveal the large structural diversity of anthocyanins and flavonoids in this popular crop.</p>",Sweet Potato; flavonoids; anthocyanin; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Molecular Network,Sweet Potato; flavonoids; anthocyanin; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Molecular Network,Untargeted metabolomics of purple and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes reveals a large structural diversity of anthocyanins and flavonoids. 10.1038/s41598-021-95901-y.

MTBLS4187,Novel Potential Diagnostic Serum Biomarkers of Metabolomics in Osteoarticular Tuberculosis Patients: A Preliminary Study,"<p>Osteoarticular tuberculosis is one of the extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which is mainly caused by direct infection of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> or secondary infection of tuberculosis in other parts. Due to the low specificity of the current detection method, it is leading to a high misdiagnosis rate and subsequently affecting the follow-up treatment and prognosis. Metabolomics is mainly used to study the changes of the body's metabolites in different states, so it can be served as an important means in the discovery of disease-related metabolic biomarkers and the corresponding mechanism research. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to detect and analyze metabolites in the serum with osteoarticular tuberculosis patients, disease controls and healthy controls to find novel metabolic biomarkers that could be used in the diagnosis of osteoarticular tuberculosis. Our results showed that 68 differential metabolites (p0.05, Fold Change1.0) were obtained in osteoarticular tuberculosis serum after statistical analysis. Then, through the evaluation of diagnostic efficacy, PC(o-16:1(9Z)/18:0), PC(20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/18:0), PC(18:0/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), SM(d18:1/20:0), and SM(d18:1/18:1(11Z)) were found as potential biomarkers with high diagnostic efficacy. Using bioinformatics analysis, we further found that these metabolites share many lipids metabolic signaling pathways, such as choline metabolism, sphingolipid signaling, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid, these results suggest that lipid metabolism plays an important role in the pathological process of tuberculosis. This study can provide certain reference value for the study of metabolic biomarkers of osteoarticular tuberculosis and the mechanism of lipid metabolism in osteoarticular tuberculosis and even other tuberculosis diseases.</p>",skeletal tuberculosis; biomarker; Lipidomics; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,skeletal tuberculosis; biomarker; Lipidomics; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,Novel Potential Diagnostic Serum Biomarkers of Metabolomics in Osteoarticular Tuberculosis Patients: A Preliminary Study.,,,"<p>From November 2018 to November 2019, 29 serum samples of diagnosed <strong>osteoarticular tuberculosis</strong> patients (<strong>TB group</strong>), 30 serum samples of <strong>disease control</strong> contained rheumatoid arthritis patients and ankylosing spondylitis patients (<strong>DC group</strong>), 30 serum samples of <strong>healthy control</strong> individuals (<strong>HC group</strong>) were collected from the 1st and the 8th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital.

MTBLS7006,The Toxoplasma micropore mediates endocytosis for selective nutrient salvage from host cell compartments,"<p>Apicomplexan parasite growth and replication relies on nutrient acquisition from host cells, in which intracellular multiplication occurs, yet the mechanisms that underlie the nutrient salvage remain elusive. Numerous ultrastructural studies have documented a plasma membrane invagination with a dense neck, termed the micropore, on the surface of intracellular parasites. However, the function of this structure remains unknown. Here we validate the micropore as an essential organelle for endocytosis of nutrients from the host cell cytosol and Golgi in the model apicomplexan <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>. Detailed analyses demonstrated that Kelch13 is localized at the dense neck of the organelle and functions as a protein hub at the micropore for endocytic uptake. Intriguingly, maximal activity of the micropore requires the ceramide de novo synthesis pathway in the parasite. Thus, this study provides insights into the machinery underlying acquisition of host cell-derived nutrients by apicomplexan parasites that are otherwise sequestered from host cell compartments.</p>",Toxoplasma; untargeted metabolites; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; auxin-inducible degron,Toxoplasma; untargeted metabolites; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; auxin-inducible degron,The Toxoplasma micropore mediates endocytosis for selective nutrient salvage from host cell compartments. 10.1038/s41467-023-36571-4.

The parental lines and derived lines (<strong>Data S1</strong>&nbsp;in the paper associated with this study) were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts HFF-1 (ATCC SCRC-1041) in D5 media composed of Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (12800-082, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10099-141, Gibco), 2mM glutamine (G0200, Solarbio Biotech) and 100 units penicillin-streptomycin (P1410, Solarbio Biotech) at 37 C with 5% CO2. HFF-1 cells were cultured in the same media and conditions, and were all maintained as mycoplasma negative<strong>[3]</strong>. The TIR1 parental line, and their derived AID lines were cultured in HFF monolayers with 500mM auxin (I2886, Sigma-Aldrich) (+IAA) or 0.1% ethanol alone (IAA) for phenotypic assays, as previously described<strong>[2][4]</strong>. Parasites were allowed to naturally egress or were mechanically lysed by passing through 22g needles, and harvested by filtration through 3.0 m polycarbonate membranes, from which extracellular parasites were used for experimental assays.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plasmid design and construction</strong></p><p>All plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) were generated by a Basic Seamless Cloning and Assembly kit (CU201-02, TransGen Biotech) using existing plasmids as templates. Briefly, the pCas9-sgRNA plasmids were generated using a previously described plasmid (Addgene 54467) as the template, and 3 fragments were amplified using 3 pairs of primers named as Cas9-F1/R1, Cas9-sgRNA xx/Cas9-R2 and Cas9-F2/R3 (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The Cas9-sgRNA xx primer contains the sgRNA sequences (20 mer) which target a specific locus either upstream of the start codon (pCas9-sgRNA 5) or downstream of the stop codon (pCas9-sgRNA 3). The sgRNA design was selected from the prediction webpage<strong>[5]</strong>. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the C-terminus of a gene were generated previously<strong>[4]</strong>, such as pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR (addgene 86669), pLinker-AID-Ty-HXGPRT (addgene 86667) and pLinker-AID-3xHA-HXGPRT (addgene 86553), or generated in this study by cloning the fragment of AID-Ty or TurboID-Ty (amplified from addgene 1116904) into the backbone of pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR, producing pLinker-AID-Ty-DHFR and pLinker-TurboID-Ty-DHFR. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the N-terminus of a gene were generated using the backbone of a plasmid named pN-Ty-DHFR or pN-Ty-HXGPRT<strong>[6]</strong>, by replacement of the Ty region with Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, C-myc-AID, 6HA or 6Ty. Primers used for the plasmid generation were listed for each plasmid in <strong>Data S3</strong> and plasmids generated in this study were listed in <strong>Data S2</strong>. The DNA regions, including epitopes, AID and TurboID in the newly prepared plasmids were checked by DNA sequencing. The plasmid for complementation of the Ty-AID- Kelch13 line was generated by cloning the Kelch13 fragment into pN-Ty-HXGPRT to replace the Ty region and was generated using primers listed in <strong>Data S3</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation of T. gondii lines</strong></p><p>CRISPR-Cas9 tagging technology was used for generation of all lines (<strong>Data S1</strong>) that contain endogenous fusions at the C-terminus of proteins, and at the N-terminus of proteins in the parental lines of the RHku80KO or TIR1 line<strong>[4]</strong>. In brief, the CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3 plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 5 plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) can efficiently produce Cas9 and sgRNA to create DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in parasites, and facilitates the integration of a tagging amplicon. The amplicon for the C-terminal tagging was generated from a generic plasmid (with the name pLinker-) containing a tag (6HA, AID-3xHA, AID-3Ty, 6Ty or TurboID-3Ty, etc) as described above, using a pair of primers L and T (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The amplicon for the N-terminal tagging was generated from a generic tagging plasmid (with the name pN-) containing a tag (Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, myc-AID) using a pair of primers M and NL. The amplicon was then combined with the corresponding CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3 or 5 plasmid (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and transfected into recipient lines. The drug selection was followed on the second day based on the resistance marker used in the amplicons. The resistance markers with LoxP sites were excised by transfection with pmini-Cre<strong>[7]</strong>. The cpl gene in the TIR1-AID lines was deleted using a similar CRISPR-Cas9 strategy<strong>[3]</strong>. The complementation lines were generated by direct transfection with the plasmids containing the wild type gene (<strong>Data S2</strong>). Transfection and drug selection were performed with 25mug/mL mycophenolic acid (M5255, Sigma-Aldrich) and 25mug/mL 6-xanthine (X4002, Sigma-Aldrich), 200mug/mL 6-thioxanthine (S96242, Shanghai Yuanye Biotech), or 3muM pyrimethamine (46706, Sigma-Aldrich)<strong>[4][6]</strong>. The lines were confirmed by IFA and diagnostic PCR, as illustrated in <strong>Figure S3a/S3b</strong>, and the PCR was designed for testing the integration site and the endogenous region with primers listed in <strong>Data S3</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Huynh MH, Carruthers VB.

MTBLS1188,Mapping immune variation and var gene switching in naive hosts infected with Plasmodium falciparum,"Falciparum malaria is clinically heterogeneous and the relative contribution of parasite and host in shaping disease severity remains unclear. We explored the interaction between inflammation and parasite variant surface antigen (VSA) expression, asking whether this relationship underpins the variation observed in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). We uncovered marked heterogeneity in the host response to blood challenge; some volunteers remained quiescent, others triggered interferon-stimulated inflammation and some showed transcriptional evidence of myeloid cell suppression. Significantly, only inflammatory volunteers experienced hallmark symptoms of malaria. When we tracked temporal changes in parasite VSA expression to ask whether variants associated with severe disease rapidly expand in naive hosts, we found no transcriptional evidence to support this hypothesis. These data indicate that parasite variants that dominate severe malaria do not have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage; instead, they presumably rely upon infection-induced changes in their within-host environment for selection.",MALARIA; PfEMP-1; antigenic variation; Severe disease; immune response; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics,MALARIA; PfEMP-1; antigenic variation; Severe disease; immune response; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics,Mapping immune variation and var gene switching in naive hosts infected with Plasmodium falciparum. 10.7554/elife.62800.

MTBLS168,The metabolic background is a global player in Saccharomyces gene expression epistasis,"The regulation of gene expression in response to nutrient availability is fundamental to the genotype-phenotype relationship. The metabolic-genetic make-up of the cell, as reflected in auxotrophy, is hence likely to be a determinant of gene expression. Here, we address the importance of the metabolic-genetic background by monitoring transcriptome, proteome and metabolome in a repertoire of 16 Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory backgrounds, combinatorially perturbed in histidine, leucine, methionine and uracil biosynthesis. The metabolic background affected up to 85% of the coding genome. Suggesting widespread confounding, these transcriptional changes show, on average, 83% overlap between unrelated auxotrophs and 35% with previously published transcriptomes generated for non-metabolic gene knockouts. Background-dependent gene expression correlated with metabolic flux and acted, predominantly through masking or suppression, on 88% of transcriptional interactions epistatically. As a consequence, the deletion of the same metabolic gene in a different background could provoke an entirely different transcriptional response. Propagating to the proteome and scaling up at the metabolome, metabolic background dependencies reveal the prevalence of metabolism-dependent epistasis at all regulatory levels. Urging a fundamental change of the prevailing laboratory practice of using auxotrophs and nutrient supplemented media, these results reveal epistatic intertwining of metabolism with gene expression on the genomic scale.",untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; epistasis,untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; epistasis,"Metabolism triggers system-wide epistasis on transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2015.30.

MTBLS2522,A general non-self response as part of plant immunity,"Plants, like other multicellular lifeforms, are colonized by microorganisms. How plants respond to their microbiota is currently not well understood. We used a phylogenetically diverse set of 39 endogenous bacterial strains from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves to assess host transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to bacterial encounters. We identified a molecular response, which we termed the general non-self response (GNSR) that involves the expression of a core set of 24 genes. The GNSR genes are not only consistently induced by the presence of most strains, they also comprise the most differentially regulated genes across treatments and are predictive of a hierarchical transcriptional reprogramming beyond the GNSR. Using a complementary untargeted metabolomics approach we link the GNSR to the tryptophan-derived secondary metabolism, highlighting the importance of small molecules in plant-microbe interactions. We demonstrate that several of the GNSR genes are required for resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Our results suggest that the GNSR constitutes a defence adaptation strategy that is consistently elicited by diverse strains from various phyla, contributes to host protection and involves secondary metabolism.",untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; Plant Immunity; Bacteria; tandem mass spectrometry; general non-self response; pathogen,untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; Plant Immunity; Bacteria; tandem mass spectrometry; general non-self response; pathogen,A general non-self response as part of plant immunity. 10.1038/s41477-021-00913-1.

In a first step, individual peak libraries were constructed for each acquisition mode (same LC method and ESI mode). Briefly, after individual subtraction of blank measurements from samples, LC-MS peaks were detected and extracted sample-wise using the <strong>emzed2</strong> implemented <strong>Metabo Feature Finder</strong> from <strong>OpenMS[1]</strong>. Individual peaks of all samples were grouped on the basis of instrument-specific tolerance levels by their m/z and retention time (RT) values into unique consensus peaks and unique peak id (pID) was assigned, where each peak was represented by its mean m/z and RT value. Since compound elemental composition and applied ESI result in a multitude of signals, peak deconvolution was required. To this end, consensus peaks were further grouped by isotopologues (consensus feature IDs, fID) and subsequently, by adducts (adduct IDs, aID) taking into account peak RTs and their specific m/z differences.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, we merged the individual consensus libraries and further grouped adducts measured with the same LC method in positive and negative ESI mode on the basis of RT and specific adduct m/z differences into cross-referring IDs (crid, used as continuous numbering system). To reduce the number of low-quality entries, we removed all features on the crid level that were not detected in at least 4/5 biological replicates in at least one treatment. Remaining crid were used to perform a targeted peak extraction on samples with missing values to update missing at random 'MAR' peaks (peaks missed by feature finding algorithm). In case of complete absence (MNAR), random values were assigned from a Gaussian distribution using mean and standard values determined from sample-specific spectral baseline and noise. Finally, to each crid monoisotopic mass value(s) were assigned and crid were grouped by their masses and to each mass a unique massID was assigned to simplify database searching and possible compound overlaps between applied LC methods. The resulting mass library was used to search publically available databases (KEGG<strong>[2]-[4]</strong>, PubChem<strong>[5]</strong> and PMN<strong>[6]</strong>) to identify compounds with matching monoisotopic mass. Manual curation was used to eliminate unlikely database matches.</p><p><br></p><p>The complete emzed workflow is available at (<a href='https://gitlab.ethz.ch/emzed2-plant-metabolomics-workflows' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://gitlab.ethz.ch/emzed2-plant-metabolomics-workflows</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>Next, averaged group areas (weighted by individual peak areas) were calculated for each crid and treatment. Before averaging, peak areas were normalized to their individual sample total ion current area. Normalization to biomass was not required since all samples were diluted to the same biomass concentration before analysis. Differential analysis was performed by comparing the weighted average group area of crids in a treatment against those in axenic control plants (Students t-test, BenjaminiHochberg P-value correction) and filtering for significant changes (|log2FC| &gt; 2, FDR &lt; 0.05).</p><p><br></p><p>Correlation analysis:</p><p>Gene expression count data was normalized in <strong>R v.3.5.1</strong> with the libraries <strong>edgeR v.3.24.3[7]</strong> and <strong>limma v.3.38.3[8]</strong>.

Spearman was the preferred method as it was observed that many genes showed distinct 'on' or 'off' states that produced misleading Pearson correlation values corresponding to the correlation of only the 2 states. Similarly, Spearman correlation values were calculated between each gene-metabolite pair between the normalized expression count and log2-normalized crid area respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Rst HL, Sachsenberg T, Aiche S, Bielow C, Weisser H, Aicheler F, Andreotti S et al.

MTBLS312,Jasmonate-mediated stomatal closure under elevated CO2 revealed by time-resolved metabolomics,"Foliar stomatal movements are critical for regulating plant water loss and gas exchange. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are known to induce stomatal closure. However, the current knowledge on CO2 signal transduction in stomatal guard cells is limited. Here we report metabolomic responses of Brassica napus guard cells to elevated CO2 using three hyphenated metabolomics platforms: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS); liquid chromatography (LC)-multiple reaction monitoring-MS; and ultra-high-performance LC-quadrupole time-of-flight-MS. A total of 358 metabolites from guard cells were quantified in a time-course response to elevated CO2 level. Most metabolites increased under elevated CO2, showing the most significant differences at 10 min. In addition, reactive oxygen species production increased and stomatal aperture decreased with time. Major alterations in flavonoid, organic acid, sugar, fatty acid, phenylpropanoid and amino acid metabolic pathways indicated changes in both primary and specialized metabolic pathways in guard cells. Most interestingly, the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis pathway was significantly altered in the course of elevated CO2 treatment. Together with results obtained from JA biosynthesis and signaling mutants as well as CO2 signaling mutants, we discovered that CO2-induced stomatal closure is mediated by JA signaling.",targeted metabolites; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; guard cell; carbon dioxide; reactive oxygen species; jasmonate signalling; stomatal movement,targeted metabolites; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; guard cell; carbon dioxide; reactive oxygen species; jasmonate signalling; stomatal movement,Jasmonate-mediated stomatal closure under elevated CO2 revealed by time-resolved metabolomics. 10.1111/tpj.13296.

MTBLS426,Sexual dimorphism in the fetal cardiac response to maternal nutrient restriction,"Poor maternal nutrition causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); however, its effects on fetal cardiac development are unclear. We have developed a baboon model of moderate maternal undernutrition, leading to IUGR. We hypothesized that the IUGR affects fetal cardiac structure and metabolism. Six control pregnant baboons ate ad-libitum (CTRL)) or 70% CTRL from 0.16 of gestation (G). Fetuses were euthanized at C-section at 0.9G under general anesthesia. Male but not female IUGR fetuses showed left ventricular fibrosis inversely correlated with birth weight. Expression of extracellular matrix protein TSP-1 was increased (p<0.05) in male IUGR. Expression of cardiac fibrotic markers TGF, SMAD3 and ALK-1 were downregulated in male IUGRs with no difference in females. Autophagy was present in male IUGR evidenced by upregulation of ATG7 expression and lipidation LC3B. Global miRNA expression profiling revealed 56 annotated and novel cardiac miRNAs exclusively dysregulated in female IUGR, and 38 cardiac miRNAs were exclusively dysregulated in males (p<0.05). Fifteen (CTRL) and 23 (IUGR) miRNAs, were differentially expressed between males and females (p<0.05) suggesting sexual dimorphism, which can be at least partially explained by differential expression of upstream transcription factors (e.g. HNF4a, and NF?B p50). Lipidomics analysis of fetal cardiac tissue exhibited a net increase in diacylglycerol and plasmalogens and a decrease in triglycerides and phosphatidylcholines. In summary, IUGR resulting from decreased maternal nutrition is associated with sex-dependent dysregulations in cardiac structure, miRNA expression, and lipid metabolism. If these changes persist postnatally, they may program offspring for higher later life cardiac risk.",Lipidomics; maternal undernutrition; cardiac fibrosis; sexual dimorphism; Autophagy; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MicroRNA,Lipidomics; maternal undernutrition; cardiac fibrosis; sexual dimorphism; Autophagy; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MicroRNA,Sexual dimorphism in the fetal cardiac response to maternal nutrient restriction. 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.06.006. PMID:28641979,,,"38 female baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) from the Southwest National Primate Research Center at San Antonio, Texas, USA were recruited for this study and maintained in group housing.</p>Surgical procedures were performed by a fully certified MD or DVM, and postsurgical care was prescribed and monitored by a primate center veterinarian. Cesarean sections were performed at 165d G (0.9G) using standard techniques that have been previously described in detail[1]. All baboons were premedicated with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg, i.m.). After intubation, isoflurane (2%) was used to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia throughout surgery. Following hysterotomy, the umbilical cord was identified and used for fetal exsanguination while under general anesthesia as approved by the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia. The placenta and fetus were removed from the uterus and immediately submitted for morphometric analyses and tissue sampling. Fetal morphometrics was obtained at necropsy. Post-operative maternal analgesia was by buprenorphine hydrochloride (Buprenorphine HCl Injection, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) 0.015 mg/kg/d split as 2 doses for 3 days. After recovery in individual cages, mothers were returned to their group housing.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Schlabritz-Loutsevitch NE, Dudley CJ, Gomez JJ, Nevill CH, Smith BK, Jenkins SL, McDonald TJ, Bartlett TQ, Nathanielsz PW, Nijland MJ.

MTBLS773,Application of HPLC-PDA-MS metabolite profiling to investigate the effect of growth temperature and day length on blackcurrant fruit,"INTRODUCTION: Blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) is an excellent example of a super fruit with potential health benefits. Both genotype and cultivation environment are known to affect the chemical composition of blackcurrant, especially ascorbic acid and various phenolic compounds. Environmental conditions, like temperature, solar radiation and precipitation can also have significant impact on fruit chemical composition. The relevance of the study is further accentuated by the predicted and ongoing changes in global climate. </br> OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to provide new knowledge and a deeper understanding of the effects of post flowering environmental conditions, namely temperature and day length, on fruit quality and chemical composition of blackcurrant using an untargeted high performance liquid chromatographyphoto diode arraymass spectrometry (HPLCPDAMS) metabolomics approach. </br> METHODS: A phytotron experiment with cultivation of single-stemmed potted plants of blackcurrant cv. Narve Viking was conducted using constant temperatures of 12, 18 or 24 C and three different photoperiods (short day, short day with night interruption, and natural summer daylight conditions). Plants were also grown under ambient outdoor conditions. Ripe berries were analysed using an untargeted HPLCPDAMS metabolomics approach to detect the presence and concentration of molecules as affected by controlled climatic factors. </br> RESULTS: The untargeted metabolomics dataset contained a total of 7274 deconvolved retention time-m/z pairs across both electrospray ionisation (ESI) positive and negative polarities, from which 549 metabolites were identified or minimally annotated based upon accurate mass MS. Conventional principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with the Friedman significance test were applied to first identify which metabolites responded to temperature in a linear fashion. Multi-block hierarchical PCA in combination with the Friedman significance test was secondly applied to identify metabolites that were responsive to different day length conditions. Temperature had significant effect on a total of 365 metabolites representing a diverse range of chemical classes. It was observed that ripening of the blackcurrant berries under ambient conditions, compared to controlled conditions, resulted in an increased accumulation of 34 annotated metabolites, mainly anthocyanins and flavonoids. 18 metabolites were found to be regulated differentially under the different daylength conditions. Moreover, based upon the most abundant anthocyanins, a comparison between targeted and untargeted analyses, revealed a close convergence of the two analytical methods. Therefore, the study not just illustrates the value of non-targeted metabolomics approaches with respect to the huge diversity and numbers of significantly changed metabolites detected (and which would be missed by conventional targeted analyses), but also shows the validity of the non-targeted approach with respect to its precision compared to targeted analyses. </br> CONCLUSIONS: Blackcurrant maturation under controlled ambient conditions revealed a number of insightful relationships between environment and chemical composition of the fruit. A prominent reduction of the most abundant anthocyanins under the highest temperature treatments indicated that blackcurrant berries in general may accumulate lower total anthocyanins in years with extreme hot summer conditions. HPLCPDAMS metabolomics is an excellent method for broad analysis of chemical composition of berries rich in phenolic compounds. Moreover, the experiment in controlled phytotron conditions provided additional knowledge concerning plant interactions with the environment.",untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; flavonoids; anthocyanin; flavonols; climate; temperature; short day length regimen; long day length regimen; tandem mass spectrometry,untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; flavonoids; anthocyanin; flavonols; climate; temperature; short day length regimen; long day length regimen; tandem mass spectrometry,Application of HPLCPDAMS metabolite profiling to investigate the effect of growth temperature and day length on blackcurrant fruit. 10.1007/s11306-018-1462-5.,,,"Raising and cultivation of blackcurrant plants (cultivar Narve Viking from the Norwegian breeding program) and the physical conditions during the experiment are explained in a previous publication[1].</p>In brief, following raising of blackcurrant plants under standardised controlled conditrions within the Polytron system, during the last 3 weeks of berry maturation, the plants were exposed to constant temperatures of 12, 18, and 24 C (1 C) combined with the following photoperiodic conditions: (1) natural long summer day (LD 18 h), (2) 10 h artificial short day (SD), and (3) 10 h SD + 3 h night interruption (SD + NI). Both treatments 1 and 3 were perceived as long day conditions by the plants, but the former also provided a 9% larger daily light integral (total daily photosynthetic active radiation). On the other hand, by using low intensity incandescent lamps for the night interruption (approximately 7 mumol quanta/m^2/s), the daily light integral varied by less than 0.5% between treatments 2 and 3, which represent the true photoperiodic test. Plants were also grown outdoors in pots (as a control) under ambient summer conditions (5940N).</p>Berries were harvested when fully ripe as judged by berry softness and visual assessment of colour. Berries from one cluster were harvested from the mid-part of 2 plants into a 50 ml tube and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C.</p>The experiment design was fully factorial with a split-plot design, with temperatures as main plots and photoperiod as a subplot. The experiment was replicated with 4 randomised blocks, each comprising 2 blackcurrant plants on a separate trolley, giving 8 plants per treatment.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Woznicki TL, Heida OM, Snsteby A, Wold A-B, Fagertun Remberg S.

The samples were next agitated for 30 min with a Heidolph multireax shaker set to speed 10 and centrifuged at 3220 x g for 10 min with an Eppendorf 5810R at 4000 rpm and 3 C (rotor A-4-62).</p>500 l of supernatant was transferred to each of 2 x 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf Safe-Lock) per sample extract and dried by speed vacuum concentration at 30 C for 6 h using the MiVac Duo concentrator system (S.P. Scientific, UK). Preparatory blank extracts were prepared identically, as were 12 extracts of Quality Control (QC) samples that contained an equal mix of all blackcurrant sample materials.</p>Prior to HPLC-PDA-MS analysis, the first set of samples were reconstituted in 250 l of 20% methanol:80% water containing 0.5 mM morin to serve as an internal standard, the samples were shaken for 30 min at 2000 rpm on an Ika Vibrax VXR shaker platform, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3 C and at 18407 x g with an Eppendorf 5424R at 14000 rpm (rotor FA-45-24-11). The extract supernatants were next filtered with 0.45um PTFE filter vials (Thomson single step) and transferred to 2 ml HPLC vials with pre-slit caps (Thermo-Fisher, Chromacol 2SVW and 9-SCK(B)-ST1 X, respectively). The samples were stored in the autosampler at 10 C and analysed within 48 h of reconstitution in positive electrospray ionisation (ESI) mode, after which the ESI source spray cone and ion tube were cleaned, the second set of samples were reconstituted and again analysed within 48 h of reconstitution in ESI negative mode.","HPLC separations were performed with a Thermo Accela 600 HPLC system coupled with an Accela PDA detector (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. U.K). The HPLC was operated at a flow rate of 300 l/min, the column and guard column (Synergi C18 Hydro-RP 80 A, 150 x 2.0 mm, 4 m particle size; Phenomenex Ltd.) were maintained at a temperature of 30 C. The solvent A, HPLC grade water, and solvent B, HPLC grade acetonitrile, were acidified with 0.1% [v/v] MS grade formic acid. A sample injection volume of 10 l was employed in full-loop mode.</p>The gradient programme was as follows: hold 2% B 0-2 min, 2-5% B 2-5 min, 5-45% B 5-25 min, 45-100% B 25-26 min, hold 100% B 26-29 min, 1002% B 26-30 min, hold 2% B 30-35 min. Autosampler syringe and line washes were performed with 8:2 acetonitrile:water.</p>The HPLC column eluent was first monitored by the Accela PDA detector where spectra were collected in wavelength/absorbance mode from 200-600 nm with a filter bandwidth and wavelength step of 1 nm, the filter rise time was 1 s, the sample rate was 5 Hz. Additionally three channel set points were employed, Channel A 280 nm, Channel B 365 nm, Channel C 520 nm, with a bandwidth of 9 nm and a sample rate of 10 Hz.","The PDA detector eluent was next transfered to a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometry system operated under Xcalibur software (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. UK). Mass spectra were primarily collected in full scan mode (m/z 100-2000) at a mass resolution of 30,000 (FWHM defined at m/z 400) within the FT detector for all samples.</p>2 further methods were applied to obtain ion trees by performing data-dependent analysis (DDA) at MS2 and MS3 levels for the mixed QA samples.</p>The first method applied a primary full scan event within the FT, followed by a secondary scan event within the LTQ-IT to collect MS2 CID fragmentation spectra for the top 3 most intense ions as defined within the preliminary full MS scan.</p>The second method was identical, but applied a further tertiary MS scan event where the top 3 most intense ions detected in each MS2 spectrum, were taken forward for further CID fragmentation and MS3 collection within the LTQ-IT.</p>Helium was applied as a collision gas for CID at a normalised collision energy of 45%, a trapping window width of 2 (+/- 1) m/z was applied, an activation time of 30 ms and activation Q of 0.25 were applied, only singly charged ions were selected for DDA, isotopic ions were also excluded.</p>The preliminary full scan event within the FT generated 'profile' mode spectral data, whereas the LTQ-IT MS2 and MS3 data were collected in centroid mode. To obtain MS2 and MS3 data for as broad range of ions as possible, the DDA MS2 and MS3 methods can be applied several times over restricted mass ranges (e.g. 100-500 m/z; 500-1000 m/z;1000-2000 m/z).</p>A scan speed of 0.1 s and 0.4 s were apllied in the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. The Automatic Gain Control was set to 1 x 10^5 and 1 x 10^6 for the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively.</p>Prior to the analytical run the LTQ-IT and FT-MS were calibrated with the manufacturers recomended calibration mixture and procedures.</p>The following settings were applied to ESI: Spray voltage -3.5 kV (ESI-) and +4.5 kV (ESI+); Sheath gas 60; Aux gas 30; Capilary voltage -35 V (ESI-) +35 V (ESI+); Tube lens voltage -100 V (ESI-) and +100 V (ESI+); Capilary temperture 280 C; ESI probe temperature 100 C.</p>For the first 2 minutes of analysis the eluent flow was directed to waste, whereas from 2-29 min the eluent was directed to the MS detector, before being directed back to waste between 29-35 min.</p>The samples were analysed in a completely randomised order as 2 independent analytical blocks respective of ESI positive and ESI negative polarities. For each analytical block, initially 8 injections of QA sample were performed for LC-MS system conditioning, after which 3 further injections of QA sample were performed, followed by 5-6 injections of experimental samples and a further QA injection. This was repeated until all samples were analysed, finally the analytical block was concluded with a further 2 QA injections. A control blank sample was analysed at the start and end of the analytical block, which was finally concluded by collection of the DDA MS2 and MS3 profiles.","The HPLC-PDA-MS raw data profiles were first converted into an mzML centroid format within the Proteowizard (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) MSConvert software package. Each mzML based 3D data matrix (intensity x m/z x time  1 per sample) was converted (or deconvolved) into a vector of peak responses, where a peak response is defined as the sum of intensities over a window of specified mass and time range (e.g. m/z = 102.1  0.01 and time = 130  10 s).</p>In this experiment the deconvolution was performed using the freely available XCMS online package (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/).</p>XCMS online was operated with the following parameter set points: Feature detection; method  CentWave; mass error 5 ppm, minimum and maximum peak width 10 and 60 s respectively, mzdiff 0.01, S/N threshold 6, integration method 1, prefilter peaks 3, prefilter intensity 50,000, noise filter 100,000: RT correction; method  Obiwarp, profstep 1: Alignment; minfrac 0.5, mz width 0.015, bw 5, min samp 1, max samp 100: Annotation; Search for isotopes+adducts, mz absolute error 0.015, ppm error 5.","Annotation and identification of each detected RT-m/z pair was performed by applying a set of workflows known as PutMedID[1][2]. Metabolite identifications were primarily made based upon the accurate mass full MS data applying a library of known plant metabolites obtained from the Plant Metabolic Network PlantCyc database (http://www.plantcyc.org) in addition to the Manchester Metabolomics Database (MMD: http://dbkgroup.org/MMD/).</p>Further to performing accurate mass based annotation, the molecular formulae presented for each feature were additionally validated based upon an isotopic peak ratio check performed manually within Xcalibur.</p>The PDA absorbance was also checked against available literature and an inhouse database of soft fruit phenolic compounds, the MS2 and MS3 fragmentation spectra were also matched to the inhouse database of soft fruit phenolic compounds.</p>Where reference standards were available, HPLC RT, High Resolution (HR)MS accurate mass, MS2 and MS3 spectra, were all matched to those of the sample extracts, thus providing an MSI level 1 identification[3].</p>Where MS2 and MS3 data were not captured for a given blackcurrant metabolite within this studies sample set, MS2 and MS3 data acquired with previous blackcurrant sample populations, where available, were alternatively considered.</p>Where an RT-m/z pair was matched to multiple molecular formulae, or a single molecular formula, but matched to multiple metabolites, an MSI Level 3 identification was attributed.</p>Where a RT-m/z pair was matched to a single molecular formula and metabolite, an MSI Level 2 identification was attributed. If in addition, MS2 and MS3 data matched those available within the Mass Bank European database (when reference standards were unavailable), then the RT-m/z pair was attributed a MSI Level 2+ identification. Where PDA absorbance and HPLC RT information complimiented that available in the literature, MSI Level 2 and 2+ identifications were considered as high confidence.</p>Unknown peaks were attributed an MSI Level 4 identification.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Brown M, Dunn WB, Dobson P, Patel Y, Winder CL, Francis-McIntyre S, Begley P, Carroll K, Broadhurst D, Tseng A, Swainston N, Spasic I, Goodacre R, Kell DB.

At late infection stage (5 days of incubation), all cultures were recovered and filtrated and the endometabolome was investigated. The healthy cells which were exposed to the exudates of the infected cells were assigned as exposed cells. Healthy cell populations were taken as the controls.

MTBLS165,Changes in the Milk Metabolome of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) with Time after Birth  Three Phases in Early Lactation and Progressive Individual Differences,"Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 16 (Phase 1), days 720 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk. These findings have implications for the dependence of the ontogeny of all species of bears, and potentially other members of the Carnivora and beyond, on the complexity and sequential changes in maternal provision of micrometabolites in the immediate period after birth.",untargeted metabolites; Lactation; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,untargeted metabolites; Lactation; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Changes in the Milk Metabolome of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) with Time after Birth--Three Phases in Early Lactation and Progressive Individual Differences. 10.1371/jourl.pone.0143417.

Primers F1 (TGGAACAGACACCTAAGTCTTGGTC) and R6 (CAGACACCAAGTGGCTTCTCCCAGG) were used for genotyping (WT allele: 856 bps, KO allele: 445 bps). The two mouse mutant mice were bred to homozygosity in 2 generations on the&nbsp;C57BL/6N genetic background and maintained in a temperature-controlled facility (20-22 C) on a 12hour light/dark cycle (7AM-7PM) with free access to standard chow diet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Phenotyping:</strong></p><p>The homozygous animals, 7 to 8 males and females, from the LAT and MX2 KO lines, were obtained from homozygotes breeding at the 3rd generation. Wild-type control individuals were derived from the C57BL/6N colony kept at the MCI-ICS which are maintained under the same conditions. Phenotyping data were collected between the age of 4 and 16 weeks. Both mutant mouse lines and wild-type littermates were tested through a broad-based primary phenotyping pipeline in all the major adult organ systems and most areas of major human diseases. Phenotyping tests are standardized and cross validated between centers of the consortium. All the data from mutant and wild-type are available in the <a href='https://www.mousephenotype.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>IMPC database</a>. The preclinical dataset from this study corresponds to the 213 numerical variables from the database.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Brown SDM, Holmes CC, Mallon AM, Meehan TF, Smedley D, Wells S.

Briefly, a volume of 200 mul of methanol containing internal standards at 3.75 g/ml (Dimetridazole, 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), Dinoseb (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) was added to the 50 l of plasma. The resulting samples were then left on ice for 90 min until complete protein precipitation. After a centrifugation step at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 C, supernatants were collected and dried under a nitrogen stream using a TurboVap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) and stored at -80 C until analysis. Prior to LC-MS analysis, dried extracts were resuspended in 150l of 10 mM ammonium carbonate&nbsp;(pH 10.5) and acetonitrile (40:60, v/v) containing the external standards (mixture of 13C-glucose and 15N-aspartate at 200 g/ml, ethylmalonic acid at 30 g/ml, amiloride at 100 g/ml, prednisone, atropine sulfate and metformin at 10 g/ml, colchicine and imipramine at 5 g/ml) for ZIC-pHILIC analysis or H2O/Acetonitrile (95:5, v/v), containing 0.1% formic acid and the external standards for C18 analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>For further analysis under HSS T3 C18 conditions, 100 l of mouse plasma were extracted as follows: samples were slowly thawed on ice at room temperature and protein precipitation was performed by addition of 150 l of ice-cold methanol. This mixture was vortexed and placed at -20 C for 30 min. After a 10-min centrifugation (4 C, 15493 x g, Sigma 3-16PK, Fischer Bioblok Scientific), the supernatant was divided into 2 aliquots, dried completely (EZ2.3 Genevac, Biopharma Technologies France) and stored at -80 C until further analysis. Just before analysis, 200 l of injection solvents (water and acetonitrile 50/50 + 0.1% formic acid) was added to the dry fractions. A pooled QC sample was prepared by mixing 5 L from each extracted sample.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Liver:</strong></p><p>Mouse liver metabolites extraction was performed from ~25 mg of tissue. Samples were re-suspended in 170 l of ultrapure water, and then sonicated 5 times for 10 s using a sonication probe (Vibra Cell, Bioblock Scientific, Illkirch, France). At this step, 20 l of each sample were withdrawn for further determining the total protein concentration (colorimetric quantification / Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France). A volume of 350 l of methanol containing internal standards at 3.75 g/ml was added to the remaining 150 l of tissue lysate. Cell debris were then removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 C and 20,000 x g. The resulting samples were then left on ice for 90 min until complete protein precipitation. After a final centrifugation step at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 C, supernatants were recovered and split into 2 equal aliquots for C18 and HILIC analyses. Resulting aliquots were then dried under a stream of nitrogen using a TurboVap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) and stored at -80 C until analysis. Prior to LC-MS analysis, dried extracts were re-suspended to reach a fixed protein concentration (equivalent to 20 mg/ml) as described above for metabolite analysis using C18 and ZIC-pHILIC columns, respectively. After reconstitution, the tubes were vortexed and incubated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 C. Supernatant was transferred into 0.2 ml vials. A quality control (QC) sample was obtained by pooling 20 l of each sample preparation. QC samples were injected every 10 samples in order to evaluate the signal variations of any metabolite, while the external standards added to all samples were used to check for consistency of signal and retention time stability throughout the experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Boudah S, Olivier MF, Aros-Calt S, Oliveira L, Fenaille F, Tabet JC, Junot C.

All chromatographic systems were equipped with an on-line prefilter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France). Experimental settings for each LC/MS condition are described below. Mobile phases for the C18 column were 100% water in A and 100% acetonitrile in B, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Regarding HILIC, phase A consisted of an aqueous buffer of 10 mM ammonium carbonate in water adjusted to pH 10.5 with ammonium hydroxide, whereas pure acetonitrile was used as solvent B. Chromatographic elutions were achieved under gradient conditions as follows: (i) C18-based system: the flow rate was set at 500 l/min. The elution consisted of an isocratic step of 2 min at 5% phase B, followed by a linear gradient from 5 to 100% of phase B for the next 11 min. These proportions were kept constant for 12.5 min before returning to 5% B for 4.5 min; (ii) HILIC-based system: the flow rate was 200 l/min. Elution started with an isocratic step of 2 min at 80% B, followed by a linear gradient from 80 to 40% of phase B from 2 to 12 min. The chromatographic system was then rinsed for 5 min at 0% B, and the run ended with an equilibration step of 15 min (80% B).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>HSS T3 C18 analyses:</strong></p><p>To retain very polar compounds while keeping the elution of less polar metabolites, an HSS T3 column was selected as complementary method<strong>[1]</strong>, as this bonding process utilizes a trifunctional C18-alkyl phase bonded at an intermediate 1.6 lmol/m^2 ligand density to promote highly polar compounds retention, without extensive retention of less polar components. Metabolic profiles were determined using an U3000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled to a high-resolution Bruker Impact ll UHR-QTOF (Bruker Daltonics, Wissembourg, France) equipped with an electrospray source (ESI). Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters HSS T3 column (150 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 m) at 0.4 ml/min, 30 C and using an injection volume of 5 l. Mobile phases A and B were water and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, respectively. The gradient elution was 0% B (2 min), 0-100% B (13 min), 100% B (7 min), 100-0% B (0.1 min) and 0% B (3.9 min for re-equilibration).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pereira H, Martin JF, Joly C et al.

The mass spectrometer was calibrated before each analysis in both ESI polarities using the manufacturers predefined methods and recommended calibration mixture provided by the manufacturer (external calibration). The Exactive mass spectrometer was operated with capillary voltage at -3 kV in the negative ionization mode and 5 kV in the positive ionization mode and a capillary temperature set at 280 C. The sheath gas pressure and the auxiliary gas pressure were set, respectively, at 60 and 10 arbitrary units with nitrogen gas. The mass resolution power of the analyzer was 50,000 (full width at half maximum) at m/z 200, for singly charged ions.

Variables whose mean intensity in the biological samples was less than 3 times that of the blanks were discarded. Variables whose linear (Pearson) correlation between the intensity in diluted quality controls (QC; pools of the biological samples) and the inverse of the dilution factor were not greater than 0.7 were discarded in the Orbitrap datasets. The signal drift was corrected for each variable by computing a loess regression on the sample intensities (span = 2). Drift estimation based on samples is of interest when the QC values do not capture the drift precisely enough, as was the case in several of the datasets. Variables with a coefficient of variation in the pools above 30% or greater than the coefficient of variation in the samples were filtered out. Chemically redundant features (i.e. isotopes, adducts, fragments) were discarded based on the conjunction of 3 criteria<strong>[4]</strong>: pearson correlation of sample profiles above 0.9, difference between retention times below 6 s, and m/z difference matching a reference list corresponding to isotopes, adducts and fragments at a 0.005 Da tolerance. Finally, intensities were log2 transformed. All these steps were performed with the <a href='https://github.com/SciDoPhenIA/phenomis' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>phenomis R package</a>.

MTBLS2469,A Multi-omics Longitudinal Study Reveals Alteration of the Leukocyte Activation Pathway in COVID-19 Patients,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may lead to lung injury, multi-organ failure, and eventually death. Cytokine storm due to excess cytokine production has been associated with fatality in severe infections. However, the specific molecular signatures associated with the elevated immune response are yet to be elucidated. We performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and metabolomic analysis of COVID-19 plasma samples collected at two time points. Using Orbitrap Fusion LC-MS/MS-based label-free proteomic analysis, we identified around 10 significant proteins, 32 significant peptides, and 5 metabolites that were dysregulated at the severe time points. Few of these proteins identified by quantitative proteomics were validated using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay. Integrated pathway analysis using distinct proteomic and metabolomic signatures revealed alterations in complement and coagulation cascade, platelet aggregation, myeloid leukocyte activation pathway, and arginine metabolism. Further, we highlight the role of leukocyte activation and arginine metabolism in COVID-19 pathogenesis and targeting these pathways for COVID-19 therapeutics.",COVID-19; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; leukocyte activation,COVID-19; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; leukocyte activation,A Multi-omics Longitudinal Study Reveals Alteration of the Leukocyte Activation Pathway in COVID-19 Patients. 10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00215. PMID:34379420,,,"<p>For this study, we procured leftover plasma samples from 13 patients admitted to Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Mumbai. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee, IIT Bombay, and Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases Institutional Review Board. The patients were classified as COVID-19 positive based on the COVID-19 RT-PCR test results. As advised by clinicians, based on the progression of the disease, the patients were categorized into the nonsevere to severe transition group. The disease progression was evaluated based on general symptoms, severe respiratory symptoms, SpO2 levels, and need for mechanical ventilation. The nonsevere and severe time points are represented as T1 and T2, respectively. The patient characteristics at different time points are shown in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The detailed demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in <strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study. After the biochemical tests were performed, the leftover blood (~1 ml) was collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate plasma. The separated plasma was then incubated at 56 C for 30 min for viral inactivation and further stored at 80 C in cryovials until further processing. The schematics for sample collection and workflow are shown in <strong>Fig. 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p>","<p>Plasma samples were collected from 9 patients showing nonsevere to severe transition. For severe transitions, we analyzed multiple-time-point plasma samples, which differed from patient to patient. Around 100 mul of plasma separated from the leftover blood sample was dispensed into a sterile tube, and 200 mul of prechilled absolute ethanol was added to the plasma sample. The tube was incubated in a biosafety cabinet for 1.5 h until ethanol was evaporated. To the semi-dried sample, 4x (400 mul) absolute methanol was added and vortexed briefly. The tube was incubated at 20 C overnight. The next day, the sample was centrifuged at 4 C for 30 min at 12,000 x g. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and stored at 20 C (see <strong>Fig. 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Samples were transported at 4 C to the Proteomics Lab, IIT Bombay. A total of 250 mul of the supernatant was concentrated using a SpeedVac up to a final volume of approximately 80 mul. 50 mul of the concentrated sample was dispensed in the glass vial for the MS-based metabolomic profile run. To each glass vial containing 50 mul of the metabolite extract, 0.5 mul of reserpine (10 mug/ml) was added as an internal control for capturing instrumental variation. Vials containing metabolite extract were then placed in an autosampler for metabolite profiling using Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>","<p>The extracted metabolites with added internal standards were analyzed by an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS setup, UHPLC Instrument (Ultimate 3000), coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). A Hypersil Gold column (C18, 100 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 mum particle size, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used along with water and absolute methanol with 0.1% formic acid (FA) as the eluent solvent. The capillary temperature was set at 34 C with aux gas rate at 10 and sheath gas flow at 42. A 20 min gradient was used with different concentrations of methanol flowing at 0.350 ml/min, reaching at different times are as follows: 1% at 2 min, 50% at 5 min, 98% at 14 min, and maintained till 17th min, 1% at 17.2 min and maintained till 20th min. Samples were run in batches, with every batch having an initial blank of resolving solvent (50% methanol), and the same blank was run after all samples of a particular patient.

MTBLS2771,Host autophagy mediates organ wasting and nutrient mobilization for tumor growth,"During tumor growth-when nutrient and anabolic demands are high-autophagy supports tumor metabolism and growth through lysosomal organelle turnover and nutrient recycling. Ras-driven tumors additionally invoke non-autonomous autophagy in the microenvironment to support tumor growth, in part through transfer of amino acids. Here we uncover a third critical role of autophagy in mediating systemic organ wasting and nutrient mobilization for tumor growth using a well-characterized malignant tumor model in Drosophila melanogaster. Micro-computed X-ray tomography and metabolic profiling reveal that Ras<sup>V12</sup> ; scrib<sup>-/-</sup> tumors grow 10-fold in volume, while systemic organ wasting unfolds with progressive muscle atrophy, loss of body mass, -motility, -feeding, and eventually death. Tissue wasting is found to be mediated by autophagy and results in host mobilization of amino acids and sugars into circulation. Natural abundance Carbon 13 tracing demonstrates that tumor biomass is increasingly derived from host tissues as a nutrient source as wasting progresses. We conclude that host autophagy mediates organ wasting and nutrient mobilization that is utilized for tumor growth.",untargeted metabolites; cancer; Autophagy; Cachexia; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,untargeted metabolites; cancer; Autophagy; Cachexia; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Host autophagy mediates organ wasting and nutrient mobilization for tumor growth. 10.15252/embj.2020107336.

MTBLS49,Metabolomics guides rational development of a simplified cell culture medium for drug screening against Trypanosoma brucei,"In vitro culture methods underpin many experimental approaches to biology and drug discovery. The modification of established cell culture methods to be more biologically relevant, or to optimise growth, is traditionally a laborious task. Emerging metabolomics technology enables rapid evaluation of intra- and extra-cellular metabolites, and can be applied to the rational development of cell culture medium. In this study, untargeted semi-quantitative, and targeted quantitative, metabolomic analyses of fresh and spent media revealed the major nutritional requirements for growth of bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei. The standard culture medium (HMI11) contained unnecessarily high concentrations of 32 nutrients that were subsequently removed to more closely resemble concentrations normally found in blood. Our new minimal medium (CMM) supports in vitro growth equivalent to HMI11, and causes no significant perturbation of metabolite levels for 94% of the detected metabolome (< 3-fold change; a = 0.05). Importantly, improved sensitivity was observed for drug activity studies in whole cell phenotypic screens, and in metabolomics mode of action assays. 400-fold decreases in IC50 were observed for pentamidine and methotrexate, suggesting inhibition of activity by nutrients present in HMI11. CMM is suitable for routine cell culture and offers important advantages for metabolomics studies and drug activity screening.",drug screening/evaluation; culture medium; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites,drug screening/evaluation; culture medium; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites,Metabolomics guides rational development of a simplified cell culture medium for drug screening against Trypanosoma brucei. 10.1128/aac.00044-13.

MTBLS492,Linking soil biology and chemistry in biological soil crust using isolate exometabolomics,"Metagenomic sequencing provides a window into microbial community structure and metabolic potential; however, linking these data to exogenous metabolites that microorganisms process and produce (the exometabolome) remains challenging. Previously, we observed strong exometabolite niche partitioning among bacterial isolates from biological soil crust (biocrust). Here we examine native biocrust to determine if these patterns are reproduced in the environment. Overall, most soil metabolites display the expected relationship (positive or negative correlation) with four dominant bacteria following a wetting event and across biocrust developmental stages. For metabolites that were previously found to be consumed by an isolate, 70% are negatively correlated with the abundance of the isolates closest matching environmental relative in situ, whereas for released metabolites, 67% were positively correlated. Our results demonstrate that metabolite profiling, shotgun sequencing and exometabolomics may be successfully integrated to functionally link microbial community structure with environmental chemistry in biocrust.",soil; Environment; environmental system; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,soil; Environment; environmental system; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Linking soil biology and chemistry in biological soil crust using isolate exometabolomics. 10.1038/s41467-017-02356-9. PMID:29296020,,,"Petri dishes (6 cm^2 x 1 cm depth) were used to core biocrust samples from the Green Butte Site near Canyonlands National Park (3842'54.1'' N, 10941'27.0'' W, Moab, UT, USA). Samples were collected along an apparent maturity gradient of Cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts ranging from light, young (level A) to darker, more mature (level D) (see Supplementary Fig. 1 in the paper associated with this study). Dry samples collected in the field were maintained in a dark desiccation chamber in the laboratory for approximately 11 months until lab-based experiments were performed consistent with previous reports[1]. Biocrusts are adapted to prolonged desiccation though it is important to note that the duration of desiccation likely affects metabolite composition and biological responses.</p>Biocrust (0.5 g) was transferred to each well within 12-well plates. Sterile LC/MS-grade water (1 ml) was added to each sample and placed under a 12 h light (~300 mumol photons/m^(2)s)/12 h dark cycle. Microcosms were completely enclosed by aluminum foil to prevent infiltration by outside light sources. At each time point (3 min, 9 h, 18 h, 42 h and 49.5 h), biocrust and soil water were removed and placed in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and 500 mul of additional water was used to rinse out the wells and added to the sample. Tubes were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min and supernatant (biocrust soil water) was pipetted and placed in new 2 ml tubes. Remaining biocrust was stored at 80 C until nucleic acid extraction was performed. There were 5 biological replicates, 5 time points and 4 successional stages of biocrust resulting in 100 total samples. An extraction control (3 replicates of water, no soil) was included and sampled at 49.5 h to evaluate background contamination. To control for abiotic metabolite processes (such as sorption, photodegradation, etc), a separate experiment was performed where soil water was sampled along the same time points (5 sampling time points in triplicate) from killed (autoclaved 4 times) biocrust from a late successional stage.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Strauss SL, Day TA, Garcia-Pichel F.

Fragmentation spectra (MS/MS) were acquired for some metabolites using collision energies of 1040 eV.</p>The negative and positive MS data for the killed controls were obtained using a Thermo QExactive.",Raw data files were converted to mzml file format using ProteoWizard msConvert.,"Metabolomics data were analyzed using Metabolite Atlas[1] (https://github.com/biorack/metatlas) in conjunction with the Python programming language to construct extracted ion chromatograms corresponding to metabolites previously detected in biocrust or contained within our in-house standards library. Note that this same analysis could be done with other open-source software packages. Authentic standards were then used to validate assignments based on 2 orthogonal data (accurate mass less than 15 p.p.m., retention time within 1 min and/or MS/MS matching major fragments) relative to standards and/or the Metlin database[2][3] and are provided in Supplementary Data 1 in the paper associated with this study. Metabolites that did not match orthogonal measures were classified as putative and are indicated by parentheses in figures. Internal standards were assessed from each sample to ensure peak area and retention times were consistent from sample-to-sample. Quality control mixtures were included at the beginning, end and throughout the runs to ensure proper instrument performance (m/z accuracy and retention time and peak area stability). Sample QC failed (internal standards were not present within the specified retention time window) for some replicates including all 9 h wetup level D samples and were not included for further analyses.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Yao Y, Sun T, Wang T, Ruebel O, Northen T, Bowen BP.

MTBLS4895,Alignment of multiple metabolomics LC-MS datasets from disparate diseases to reveal fever-associated metabolites,"<p>Acute febrile illnesses are still a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally, particularly in low to middle income countries. The aim of this study was to determine any possible metabolic commonalities of patients infected with disparate pathogens that cause fever. Three liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) datasets investigating the metabolic effects of malaria, leishmaniasis and Zika virus infection were used. The retention time (RT) drift between the datasets was determined using landmarks obtained from the internal standards generally used in the quality control of the LC-MS experiments. Fitted Gaussian Process models (GPs) were used to perform a high level correction of the RT drift between the experiments, which was followed by standard peakset alignment between the samples with corrected RTs of the three LC-MS datasets. Statistical analysis, annotation and pathway analysis of the integrated peaksets were subsequently performed. Metabolic dysregulation patterns common across the datasets were identified, with kynurenine pathway being the most affected pathway between all three fever-associated datasets.</p>",Zika Virus; malaria; visceral Leishmaniasis; Fever-associated infectious diseases; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,Zika Virus; malaria; visceral Leishmaniasis; Fever-associated infectious diseases; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,Alignment of multiple metabolomics LC-MS datasets from disparate diseases to reveal fever-associated metabolites. 10.1371/jourl.pntd.0011133.

MTBLS868,Mining for natural product antileishmanials in a fungal extract library,"Leishmaniasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease caused by the insect-vector borne protozoan parasite, Leishmania species. Infection affects millions of the Worlds poorest, however vaccines are absent and drug therapy limited. Recently, public-private partnerships have developed to identify new modes of controlling leishmaniasis. Most of these collaborative efforts have relied upon the small molecule synthetic compound libraries held by industry, but the number of New Chemical Entities (NCE) identified and entering development as antileishmanials has been very low. In light of this, here we describe a public-private effort to identify natural products with activity against Leishmania mexicana, a causative agent of cutaneous leishmanaisis (CL). Utilising Hypha Discoverys fungal extract library which is rich in small molecule (<500 molecular weight) secondary metabolites, we undertook an iterative phenotypic screening and fractionation approach to identify potent and selective antileishmanial hits. This led to the identification of a novel oxidised bisabolane sequiterpene which demonstrated activity in an infected cell model and was shown to disrupt multiple processes using a metabolomic approach. In addition, and importantly, this study also sets a precedent for new approaches for CL drug discovery.",cutaneous leishmaniasis; Leishmania mexicana; natural product; screening; fractionation; Metabolomics; Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics,cutaneous leishmaniasis; Leishmania mexicana; natural product; screening; fractionation; Metabolomics; Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics,Mining for natural product antileishmanials in a fungal extract library. 10.1016/j.ijpddr.2019.05.003.

This study investigated the effects of fermented and non-fermented Lycium barbarum residues (RFW and RW) on the meat quality and immunity of sheep (Ovis aries). Fifty-four Tan sheep were randomly divided into control, RFW or RW treatments. Data showed that RFW and RW increased the carcass weight, fat content, ash content and reduced the cooking loss of lamb. RFW performed more significant effects on activating immune-related genes than those of RW. The expression of chemokines and immune-related pathways, such as signaling pathways of interleukin-17 signaling pathway and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, were elevated in sheep fed RFW. RW increased the diversity in rumen metabolites, especially compositions of lipids, organic acids and organ heterocyclic compounds. RFW affected numerous compounds which are closely correlated with the activation of immune genes.

MTBLS8547,Dual metal electrolysis in theta capillary for lipid analysis,"<p>Increasing studies associating glycerophospholipids with various pathological conditions highlight the need for their thorough characterization. However, the intricate composition of the lipidome due to the presence of lipid isomers poses significant challenges to structural lipidomics. This study uses the anodic corrosion of two metals in a single theta nESI emitter as a tool to simultaneously characterize lipids at multiple isomer levels. Anodic corrosion of cobalt and copper in the positive ion mode generates the metal-adducted lipid complexes, [M+Co]2+ and [M+Cu]+, respectively. Optimization of parameters such as the distances of the electrodes from the nESI tip allowed the achievement of the formation of one metal-adducted lipid product at a time. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of [M+Co]2+ results in preferential loss of the fatty acyl (FA) chain at the sn-2 position, thus generating singly charged sn-specific fragment ions. Whereas, multistage fragmentation of [M+Cu]+ via CID generated a C=C bond position-specific characteristic ion pattern induced by the pi-Cu+ interaction. The feasibility of the method was tested on PC lipid extract from egg yolk to identify lipids on multiple isomer levels. Thus, the application of dual metal anodic corrosion allows lipid isomer identification with reduced sample preparation time, no signal suppression by counter anions, low sample consumption and no need for an extra apparatus.</p>",Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; structural lipidomics; lipid isomer; untargeted metabolites; metal electrolysis,Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; structural lipidomics; lipid isomer; untargeted metabolites; metal electrolysis,Dual metal electrolysis in theta capillary for lipid analysis. 10.1016/j.ijms.2023.117137.,,,"<p>All lipid standards including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatic acid (PA) and L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (95%) (Egg, Chicken) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL, USA).

MTBLS2840,SARS-CoV-2-mediated dysregulation of metabolism and autophagy uncovers host-targeting antivirals,"Viruses manipulate cellular metabolism and macromolecule recycling processes like autophagy. Dysregulated metabolism might lead to excessive inflammatory and autoimmune responses as observed in severe and long COVID-19 patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular metabolism and reduces autophagy. Accordingly, compound-driven induction of autophagy limits SARS-CoV-2 propagation. In detail, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show accumulation of key metabolites, activation of autophagy inhibitors (AKT1, SKP2) and reduction of proteins responsible for autophagy initiation (AMPK, TSC2, ULK1), membrane nucleation, and phagophore formation (BECN1, VPS34, ATG14), as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (BECN1, ATG14 oligomers). Consequently, phagophore-incorporated autophagy markers LC3B-II and P62 accumulate, which we confirm in a hamster model and lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing of patient-derivedlung and mucosal samples show differential transcriptional regulation of autophagy and immune genes depending on cell type, disease duration, and SARS-CoV-2 replication levels. Targeting of autophagic pathways by exogenous administration of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, the selective AKT1 inhibitor MK-2206, and the BECN1-stabilizing anthelmintic drug niclosamide inhibit SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 136.7, 7.67, 0.11, and 0.13muM, respectively.

MTBLS858,Inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration promotes radiosensitisation of neuroblastoma and glioma cells,"<h4><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Neuroblastoma accounts for 7% of paediatric malignancies but is responsible for 15% of all childhood cancer deaths. Despite rigorous treatment involving chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, the 5-year overall survival rate of high-risk disease remains &lt; 40%, highlighting the need for improved therapy. Since neuroblastoma cells exhibit aberrant metabolism, we determined whether their sensitivity to radiotherapy could be enhanced by drugs affecting cancer cell metabolism.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS:</strong> Using a panel of neuroblastoma and glioma cells, we determined the radiosensitising effects of inhibitors of glycolysis (2-DG) and mitochondrial function (metformin). Mechanisms underlying radiosensitisation were determined by metabolomic and bioenergetic profiling, flow cytometry and live cell imaging and by evaluating different treatment schedules.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The radiosensitising effects of 2-DG were greatly enhanced by combination with the antidiabetic biguanide, metformin. Metabolomic analysis and cellular bioenergetic profiling revealed this combination to elicit severe disruption of key glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolites, causing significant reductions in ATP generation and enhancing radiosensitivity. Combination treatment induced G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest that persisted for at least 24 h post-irradiation, promoting apoptotic cell death in a large proportion of cells.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Our findings demonstrate that the radiosensitising effect of 2-DG was significantly enhanced by its combination with metformin. This clearly demonstrates that dual metabolic targeting has potential to improve clinical outcomes in children with high-risk neuroblastoma by overcoming radioresistance.</h4>",deoxyglucose; Metformin; iobenguane (131I); sensitiser; cancer; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,deoxyglucose; Metformin; iobenguane (131I); sensitiser; cancer; untargeted metabolites; Glasgow Polyomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration promotes radiosensitisation of neuroblastoma and glioma cells. 10.1186/s40170-021-00258-5.

MTBLS3251,Transcriptional memory of dFOXO activation in youth curtails later-life mortality,"Identifying processes occurring in early life affect subsequent life and health span is an urgent aim to improve human health. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism of dFOXO in longevity determination in Drosophila. We found that early adulthood induction of dFOXO is sufficient to reduce mortality in old age through different pathways than chronic dFOXO. We showed that dFOXO requires specific ATP-dependent chromatin modifiers to extend lifespan, and we could mimic this lifespan extension by modulating dFOXOs targets in later life. Furthermore, dFOXO in early life induces a specific transcriptional programme that counteracts the natural transcriptomic changes occurring with age. Our findings provide a better understanding of transcriptional mechanisms related to longevity and opens new avenues for possible time-restricted interventions to improve human health in the future.",untargeted metabolites; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; forkhead box protein O (fruit fly); Transcriptomics,untargeted metabolites; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; forkhead box protein O (fruit fly); Transcriptomics,Transcriptional memory of dFOXO activation in youth curtails later-life mortality.,,,"<p>Whole bodies of S106 x UAS-dfoxo female flies backcrossed in the Dahomey background were used for this study. They were allowed to mate for the 2 days of adulthood, then separated in vials containing 15 flies each. RU486 was added to the food to induce expression of dFOXO in the treated group, and the same amount of ethanol was added in the control group. At day 30 they were briefly anesthetised in CO2 and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to metabolite extraction. 7 technical replicates were used for RU- condition (labelled as C) and 8 for RU+ condition (labelled as S).</p>","<p>5 whole female flies were suspended in 200 l of chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1 ratio) at 4 C containing glass beads and were homogenized at 4 C. Samples were then centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 x g at 4 C and 180 l of supernatant was subtracted and stored at -80 C for further analysis by LCMS. A pooled sample was generated by combining 20 l of each of the sample, to be used as a quality control sample in the LCMS procedure.</p>","<p>Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was carried out on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) using a ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum column, Merck Sequant). The column was maintained at 30 C and samples were eluted with a linear gradient (20 mM ammonium carbonate in water, A and acetonitrile, B) over 24 min at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min as follows: min 0, 20% A, 80% B; min 15, 80% A, 20% B; min 15, 95% A, 5% B; min 17, 95% A, 5% B; min 17, 20% A, 80% B; min 26, 20% A, 80% B.

MTBLS6677,Limited oxygen availability in standard cell culture alters metabolism and function in terminally differentiated cells,"<p>Cell culture is generally considered to be hyperoxic. However, the importance of cellular oxygen consumption is often underappreciated, with rates of oxygen consumption often sufficient to cause hypoxia at cell monolayers. We initially focused on cultured adipocytes as a terminally differentiated cell-type with substantial oxygen consumption rates to support diverse cellular functions. Under standard conditions, cultured adipocytes are hypoxic and highly glycolytic. Increasing oxygen diverted glucose flux toward mitochondria and resulted in thousands of gene expression changes that pointed toward alleviated physiological transcriptional responses to hypoxia. Phenotypically, providing more oxygen increased adipokine secretion and rendered adipocytes more sensitive to insulin and lipolytic stimuli. The functional benefits of increasing pericellular oxygen were transferable to other cellular systems including hPSC-derived hepatocytes and cardiac organoids. Our findings suggest that oxygen is limiting in many terminally-differentiated cell culture systems, and that controlling oxygen availability can improve the quality and translatability of cell models.</p>",fibroblast; cell culture; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; hypoxia; isotopic labelling,fibroblast; cell culture; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; hypoxia; isotopic labelling,Limited oxygen availability in standard cell culture alters metabolism and function in terminally differentiated cells. 10.1101/2022.11.29.516437.,,,"<p>Briefly, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamax at 37 C in 10% CO2. For hypoxia experiments, cells were cultured at 37 C in 5% O2, 5% CO2. For differentiation into adipocytes, fibroblasts were cultured in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM containing an adipogenic cocktail (350 nM insulin, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 250 nM dexamethasone for 3 d, followed by 3 d in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 350 nM insulin. Differentiated adipocytes were maintained in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM. Adipocytes were used for experiments 9-10 d after the onset of differentiation, with culture medium renewed every 2 days prior to each experiment. For low medium volume treatments, cells were cultured in either 1000 muL (high), 666 muL (mid) or 333 muL (low) medium in a 12-well plate, or 500 muL (high), 333 muL (mid) or 167 muL (low) in a 24-well plate for the duration specific to each experiment.</p>","<p>Prior to the experiment, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed once with glucose-free DMEM and labelled with 25 mM 13C-glucose in DMEM for either 4 or 16 h. Then, medium was removed from the wells and cells were washed twice with room temperature PBS and placed on dry ice. Next 250 muL metabolite extraction buffer (50% methanol, 30% acetonitrile, 20% ultrapure water, 5 M valine-d8) was added to each well of a 12-well plate and incubated for 5 min on a dry ice-methanol bath to lyse the cell membranes. After that, extracts were scraped and mixed at 4 C for 15 min in a thermomixer at 2000 rpm. After final centrifugation at max speed for 20 min at 4 C, 80 muL of the supernatant from each sample was transferred into labelled LC-MS vials.</p>","<p>Hydrophilic separation of metabolites was achieved using a Millipore Sequant ZIC-pHILIC analytical column (5 m, 2.1 x 150 mm) equipped with a 2.1 x 20 mm guard column (both 5 mm particle size) with a binary solvent system. Solvent A was 20 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.05% ammonium hydroxide; Solvent B was acetonitrile. The column oven and autosampler tray were held at 40 and 4 C, respectively. The chromatographic gradient was run at a flow rate of 0.20 mL/min as follows: 0.0-2.0 min: 80% B; 2.0-17.0 min: linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B; 17.0-17.1 min: linear gradient from 20% B to 80% B; 17.1-23.0 min: hold at 80% B. Samples were randomised and the injection volume was 5 L. A pooled quality control (QC) sample was generated from an equal mixture of all individual samples and analysed interspersed at regular intervals.</p>","<p>Metabolites were measured with Vanquish Horizon UHPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a heated electrospray ionisation source. The spray voltages were set to +3.5 / -2.8 kV, RF lens value at 70, the heated capillary held at 320 C and the auxiliary gas heater held at 280 C. The flow rate for sheath gas, aux gas and sweep gas were set to 40, 15 and 0, respectively. For MS1 scans, mass range was set to 70-900 m/z, AGC target set to standard and maximum injection time (IT) set to auto. Data acquisition for experimental samples used full scan mode with polarity switching at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000. Data acquisition for untargeted metabolite identification was performed using the AcquireX Deep Scan workflow, an iterative data-dependent acquisition (DDA) strategy using multiple injections of the pooled sample. DDA full scan-ddMS2 method for AcquireX workflow used the following parameters: full scan resolution was set to 60,000, fragmentation resolution to 30,000, fragmentation intensity threshold to 5.0E^3. Dynamic exclusion was enabled after 1 time and exclusion duration was 10 s. Mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm. Isolation window was set to 1.2 m/z. Normalised HCD collision energies were set to stepped mode with values at 30, 50, 150. Fragmentation scan range was set to auto, AGC target at standard and max IT at auto. Mild trapping was enabled.</p>","<p>Metabolite identification was performed in the Compound Discoverer software (v 3.2, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Metabolite identities were confirmed using the following parameters: (1) precursor ion m/z was matched within 5 ppm of theoretical mass predicted by the chemical formula; (2) fragment ions were matched within 5 ppm to an in-house spectral library of authentic compound standards analysed with the same ddMS2 method with a best match score of over 70; (3) the retention time of metabolites was within 5% of the retention time of a purified standard run with the same chromatographic method. Chromatogram review and peak area integration were performed using the Tracefinder software (v 5.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the peak area for each detected metabolite was normalised against the total ion count (TIC) of that sample to correct any variations introduced from sample handling to instrument analysis.

This study investigated the toxicometabolomics, particularly the in vitro metabolism of 2-(methylamino)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1-pentanone (4-MPD) and 2-(ethylamino)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1-pentanone (4-MEAP) in pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) using untargeted metabolomics techniques. Incubations were performed with the substrates in concentrations ranging from 0, 12.5, and 25 M. Analysis was done by means of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS/MS) in full scan only and the obtained data was evaluated using XCMS Online and MetaboAnalyst. Significant features were putatively identified using a separate parallel reaction monitoring method. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test for prefiltering significant features and subsequent hierarchical clustering, as well as principal component analysis (PCA). Hierarchical clustering or PCA showed a distinct clustering of all concentrations with most of the features z-scores rising with the concentration of the investigated substances. Identification of significant features left many of them unidentified but revealed metabolites of both 4-MPD and 4-MEAP. Both substances formed carboxylic acids, were hydroxylated at the alkyl chain, and formed metabolites after combined hydroxylation and reduction of the cathinone oxo group. 4-MPD additionally formed a dihydroxy metabolite and a hydroxylamine. 4-MEAP was additionally found reduced at the cathinone oxo group, N-dealkylated, and formed an oxo metabolite. These findings are the first to describe the metabolic pathways of 4-MPD and to extend our knowledge about the metabolism of 4-MEAP. Findings, particularly the MS data of the metabolites, are essential for setting up metabolite-based toxicological (urine) screening procedures.",untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Toxicology; Synthetic cathinone,untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Toxicology; Synthetic cathinone,Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry-Based In Vitro Toxicometabolomics of the Synthetic Cathinones 4-MPD and 4-MEAP in Pooled Human Liver Microsomes. 10.3390/metabo11010003.

However, mechanism insights into the cellular metabolic response of <em>Euglena</em> to different toxic chemicals and adverse environmental stresses were very limited. We extensively investigated the changes of cell biomass, pigments, lipids and paramylon of <em>E. gracilis</em> under several environmental stresses, such as heavy metal CdCl<sub>2</sub>, antibiotics paromomycin and nutrient deprivation. In addition, global metabolomics by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was applied to study other metabolites and potential regulatory mechanisms behind the differential accumulation of major high-valued metabolites.

MTBLS3887,Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis specialization in microbes is driven by biochemical constraints of flux sensing,"Central carbon metabolism is highly conserved across microbial species, but can catalyze very different pathways depending on the organism and their ecological niche. Here, we study the dynamic reorganization of central metabolism after switches between the two major opposing pathway configurations of central carbon metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. We combined growth dynamics and dynamic changes in intracellular metabolite levels with a coarse-grained model that integrates fluxes, regulation, protein synthesis, and growth and uncovered fundamental limitations of the regulatory network: After nutrient shifts, metabolite concentrations collapse to their equilibrium, rendering the cell unable to sense which direction the flux is supposed to flow through the metabolic network. The cell can partially alleviate this by picking a preferred direction of regulation at the expense of increasing lag times in the opposite direction. Moreover, decreasing both lag times simultaneously comes at the cost of reduced growth rate or higher futile cycling between metabolic enzymes. These three trade-offs can explain why microorganisms specialize for either glycolytic or gluconeogenic substrates and can help elucidate the complex growth patterns exhibited by different microbial species.",untargeted metabolites; lag time; Flux; Microbiome; Glycolysis; gluconeogenesis pathway; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,untargeted metabolites; lag time; Flux; Microbiome; Glycolysis; gluconeogenesis pathway; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis specialization in microbes is driven by biochemical constraints of flux sensing. 10.15252/msb.202110704.

MTBLS6121,Integrated omics analysis reveals the alteration of gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in Cervus elaphus kansuensis,"The gut microbiota is the largest and most complex microecosystem in animals. It is influenced by the host's dietary habits and living environment, and its composition and diversity play irreplaceable roles in animal nutrient metabolism, immunity, and adaptation to the environment. Although the gut microbiota of red deer has been studied, the composition and function of the gut microbiota in Gansu red deer (Cervus elaphus kansuensis), an endemic subspecies of red deer in China, has not been reported. In this study, the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome and fecal metabolomics of C. elaphus kansuensis were identified and compared for the first time by using 16S rDNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and LC-MS/MS. There were significant differences in gut microbiota structure and diversity between wild and farmed C. elaphus kansuensis. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the genus UCRD-005 was dominant in both captive red deer (CRD) and wild red deer (WRD). Metagenomic sequencing showed similar results to those of 16S rDNA sequencing for gut microbiota in CRD and WRD at the phylum and genus levels. 16S rDNA and metagenomics sequencing data suggested that Bacteroides and Bacillus might serve as marker genera for CRD and WRD, respectively. Fecal metabolomics results showed that 520 metabolites withsignificant differences were detected between CRD and WRD and most differential metabolites were involved in lipid metabolism. The results suggested that large differences in gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolites between CRD and WRD, indicating that different dietary habits and living environments over time have led to the development of stable gut microbiome characteristics for CRD and WRD to meet their respective survival and reproduction needs.

Ion spray voltage was 3.5 kV; Sheath gas flow rate was 35 arb; Aux Gas flow rate was 10 arb; Capillary temperature was 320 C; S-lens RF level was 60; Aux gas heater temperature was 350 C; Polarity was positive and negative; <strong>MS/MS</strong> secondary scans were data-dependent scans.</p>,"<p><strong>Compound Discoverer 3.1 software</strong> was used to convert the <strong>raw</strong> data into <strong>.mzXML</strong> format files, and then to calculate the peak alignment, peak picking, retention times and quantitation for each metabolite. The corrected 2-dimensional data matrix in <strong>EXCEL</strong> format was obtained, and the nonconforming compounds were removed by the 80% rule, that is, the MS ions that were retained in no less than 80% of the samples in each group, and the remaining missing values were supplemented with the minimum value.</p>","<p>According to the information on secondary mass spectrometry, the <strong>Thermo mzCloud online database</strong> (<a href='https://www.mzcloud.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.mzcloud.org/</a>) and <strong>mzVault</strong> and <strong>Masslist</strong> local databases were used for metabolite identification. All identified metabolites were annotated using the <strong>KEGG database</strong> (<a href='https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html</a>), <strong>HMDB database</strong> (<a href='https://hmdb.ca/ metabolites' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://hmdb.ca/ metabolites</a>), and <strong>LIPID MAPS database</strong> (<a href='http://www.lipidmaps.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.lipidmaps.org/</a>). Multivariate statistical analysis, including <strong>principal components analysis (PCA</strong>) and <strong>Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)</strong>, was then performed on the processed data to obtain the <strong>variable importance (VIP)</strong> of each metabolite. <strong>EXCEL</strong> was used to calculate the <strong>Fold change (FC)</strong> of metabolites between the 2 groups, and <strong>1-way ANOVA-t test</strong> was performed on the pre-processed data by <strong>SPSS 22.0 software</strong> to obtain the significance level <strong>P value</strong>. The metabolites with <strong>VIP &gt; 1</strong> and <strong>P-value &lt; 0.05</strong> and <strong>FC 2</strong> or <strong>0.5</strong> were considered to be <strong>differential metabolites (DMs)</strong>. The screened significantly different metabolites were imported into <strong>MetaboAnalyst 5.0</strong> online software (<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca</a>) for clustering analysis and metabolic pathway analysis.</p>",MTBLC4676;

MTBLS9794,Transcriptomic and metabolomic data of goat ovarian and uterine tissues during sexual maturation (Ovarian data),"<p>The ovaries and uterus are crucial reproductive organs in mammals, and their coordinated development ensures the normal development of sexual maturity and reproductive capacity. This study aimed to comprehensively capture the different physiological stages of the goat's sexual maturation by selecting four specific time points. We collected samples of ovarian and uterine tissues from five female Jining Gray goats at each time point: after birth (D1), 2-month-old (M2), 4-month-old (M4) and 6-month-old (M6). By combining transcriptomic sequencing of 40 samples (including rRNA-depleted RNA-seq libraries with 3607.8 million reads and miRNA-seq libraries with 444.0 million reads) and metabolomics analysis, we investigated the transcriptomic mechanisms involved in reproductive regulation in the ovary and uterus during sexual maturation, as well as the changes in metabolites and their functional potential. Additionally, we analyzed blood hormone indices and uterine tissue sections to examine temporal changes. These datasets will provide a valuable reference for the reproductive regulation of the ovary and uterus, as well as the regulation of metabolites during sexual maturation in goats.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ovarian data</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS9794' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS9794</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Uterine data</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS9795' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS9795</strong></a>.</p>",Goat; Sexual Maturation; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Goat; Sexual Maturation; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Transcriptomic and metabolomic data of goat ovarian and uterine tissues during sexual maturation. 10.1038/s41597-024-03565-w. PMID:39003290,,,"<p>The experiment was conducted at the Shandong Jiaxiang JG Goat Breeding Farm (Jining, China). A total of 20 healthy female JG goats were chosen for this study, and they were separated into the following 4 age cohorts: D1 (2.60 +/- 1.52 days), M2 (2.07 +/- 0.04 months), M4 (4.05 +/- 0.05 months) and M6 (6.06 +/- 0.06 months). Individual age cohort had total of 5 goats. Food was freely available to all goats, with breeding and management followed the same protocol. Each goat was uniformly slaughtered on its specific cut-off date. Under sterile conditions, the ovarian (O) and uterine (U) tissues from each individual were collected via surgical instruments and rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In total 40 tissue samples were promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80 C until RNA extraction for NGS library construction or metabolite extraction. Additionally, we collected uterine tissues from each age group, preserving them in a 4% formaldehyde fixation solution with the temperature consistently maintained at 4 C until ready for histological analysis. Where possible, an initial estimate of developmental stage was obtained through dissection and macroscopic examination of the uterus.</p>","<p>Following the previous reported method<strong>[1]</strong>, tissues (100 mg) were initially ground in liquid nitrogen before being resuspended in pre-chilled 80% methanol solvent by well vortex. This solvent effectively disrupts cell membranes, promotes cell lysis to release metabolites, and efficiently extracts broad spectrum metabolites, namely, both polar and non-polar substances<strong>[2]</strong>, while also demonstrating strong protein precipitation capabilities<strong>[3]</strong>. Comparative studies have shown that methanol outperforms other solvents in capturing diverse metabolites from complex biological matrices<strong>[4]</strong>. Subsequently, samples underwent a 5-min maintenance on ice, prior to a 20-min centrifugation at 15,000 x g, 4 C. A portion of supernatant underwent dilution to 53% methanol with LC-MS grade water, then, samples were placed in a fresh tube for a 20-min centrifugation at 15,000 x g, 4 C. Lastly, supernatant was used to conduct LC-MS/MS system analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Feng L, Zhang Y, Liu W, Du D, Jiang W, Wang Z, Wang Z, Hu Z.

The Vanquish UHPLC system comprised essential components, encompassing a vacuum degasser, binary pump, thermostated autosampler and column oven. Considering the need for effective retention and separation of medium polarity and non-polar metabolites, the Hypersil Gold column (C18, 100 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 mum) was utilized for sample analysis. The column set at 40 C (+/-1 C), with 0.2 mL/min flow rate and 17 min run duration. In positive mode, the mobile phase composition for A was 0.1% formic acid in water, while for B it was methanol. In negative ionization mode, mobile phase A involved a solution of 5mM ammonium acetate particularly with a pH of 9.0, whereas mobile phase B remained methanol. The gradient elution profile was precisely controlled: an initial 2% B for 1.5 min, followed by a linear elevation from 2% to 85% B over 3 min. This was succeeded by a gradual rise from 85% to 100% B over 10 min, and thereafter a decline from 100% to 2% B over 10.1 min to restore initial conditions. Finally, a 2% B equilibration step was implemented for 12 min to stabilize the system.</p>","<p>The apparatus and LC-MS setup for this analysis are described below: a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer equipped with a dual-sprayer ESI source was connected to a Vanquish UHPLC system from Thermo Fisher, Germany. To comprehensively cover the metabolome, ionization was conducted in both positive and negative ion modes to maximize the identification of two distinct sets of analytes<strong>[1]</strong>. The setting of instrument parameters was precisely undertaken: a 3.5 kV spray voltage, 320 C capillary temperature, 35 psi sheath gas flow rate and 10 L/min auxiliary gas flow rate. The S-lens RF level was accurately maintained at 60, while the temperature of the auxiliary gas heater was precisely set to 350 for optimal performance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Nordstrm A, Want E, Northen T, Lehti J, Siuzdak G.

Critical parameters encompassed a retention duration tolerance of 0.2 min, actual mass tolerance of 5 ppm, signal intensity tolerance of 30%, signal-to-noise ratio of 3, and a minimum intensity threshold of 100,000. It was attempted to normalize peak intensities to the total spectral intensity, and this normalized value was employed for predicting the molecular formula by amalgamating information from additive ions, molecular ion peaks, and fragment ions. Thereafter, the peaks were meticulously matched against the mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org/), mzVault and MassList databases. Compounds exhibiting a coefficient of variation (CV) exceeding 30% in the relative peak area within quality control, abbreviated as QC, samples were accurately excluded, ultimately resulting in the identification and relative quantification of metabolites. The subsequent statistical analyses were undertaken through R 4.3.1 and Python 3.11.4 software.</p>","<p>The peaks were meticulously matched against the mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org/), mzVault and MassList databases.</p>",MTBLC22652;

MTBLS1791,Bioaccumulation of therapeutic drugs by human gut bacteria: secreted metabolite analysis (FIA-MS) (C.saccharolyticum;E.coli;L.plantarum;L.lactis;S.salivarius assays),"<p>Bacteria in the gut can modulate the availability and efficacy of therapeutic drugs. Interactions at this level have only recently started to being systematically mapped and the main underlying mechanism proposed is chemical transformation of drugs by microbes (biotransformation). Here, we investigated the depletion of 15 structurally diverse drugs by 25 representative gut bacterial strains. This revealed 70 bacteria-drug interactions, 29 of which had not been reported before.</p><p>Over half of the new interactions can be ascribed to bioaccumulation, that is bacteria storing the drug without chemically modifying it, and in most cases without their growth being affected. As a case in point, we studied the molecular basis of bioaccumulation of the widely used antidepressant duloxetine by using click-chemistry, thermal proteome profiling and metabolomics. We find that duloxetine binds to several metabolic enzymes and changes metabolite secretion of the respective bacteria. When tested in a defined microbial community of accumulators and non-accumulators, duloxetine markedly altered the community composition through metabolic cross-feeding. We further validated our findings in an animal model, showing that bioaccumulating bacteria attenuate the behavioral response of Caenorhabditis elegans to duloxetine.</p><p>Taken together, bioaccumulation by gut bacteria might be a common mechanism that alters drug availability and bacterial metabolism, with implications for microbiota composition, pharmacokinetics, side effects and drug responses, likely in an individual manner.</p><p><br></p><p>Linked studies;</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assays </strong>of <em>Bifidobacterium animalis</em> <em>subsp. lactis</em> are reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1264' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1264</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Lacrimispora saccharolytica</em> and <em>Escherichia coli </em>IAI1 is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1319' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1319</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assays</strong> of <em>Escherichia coli </em>ED1a, <em>Clostridium saccharolyticum</em>, <em>Escherichia coli </em>IAI1, <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em>, <em>Eubacterium rectale</em>, <em>Lactobacillus plantarum</em> WCFS1 and <em>Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis</em> Il1403 are reported in<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1627' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'> <strong>MTBLS1627</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Bacteroides uniformis </em>and <em>Clostridium saccharolyticum</em> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1757' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1757</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Eubacterium rectale</em> and <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em> is reported in<strong> </strong><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1792' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1792</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Lacrimispora saccharolytica</em> and standards is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2885' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2885</strong></a>.</p><p><br></p>",flow injection analysis; untargeted metabolites; Microbiome; duloxetine; roflumilast,flow injection analysis; untargeted metabolites; Microbiome; duloxetine; roflumilast,Bioaccumulation of therapeutic drugs by human gut bacteria. 10.1038/s41586-021-03891-8.

MTBLS210,Wolbachia modulation of lipid metabolism in Aedes albopictus mosquito cells,"Certain strains of the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia can strongly inhibit or block the transmission of viruses such as dengue by Aedes mosquitoes, and the mechanisms responsible are still not well understood. Direct infusion and liquid chromatography FT-ICR mass spectrometry based lipidomicse DIMS and LCMS analyses were conducted using Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells that were infected with the wMel and wMelPop strains of Wolbachia compared to uninfected cells. Substantial shifts in the cellular lipid profile were apparent in the presence of Wolbachia. Most significantly, sphingolipids were depleted across all classes, and some reduction in diacylglyerol fatty acids and phosphatidylcholines was also observed. These lipid classes have previously been shown to be selectively enriched in DENV-infected mosquito cells, suggesting that Wolbachia may produce a cellular lipid environment that is antagonistic to viral replication. The data improve understanding of the intracellular interactions between Wolbachia and mosquitoes.",Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Lipidomics; Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry,Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Lipidomics; Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry,Wolbachia Modulates Lipid Metabolism in Aedes albopictus Mosquito Cells. 10.1128/aem.00275-16. PMID:26994075,,,"Aa23.T, Aa23.wMel and Aa23.wMelPop cells were grown in 25 cm^2 flasks as per refsec:cellculture in 5 ml of media with passaging of 1 ml to 5 ml of new media every five days. Eight flasks per line were independently passaged for at least 5 wks before lipid and DNA extraction. Cells were quenched 72 h after the final passage, before confluence was reached. A centrifuge was pre-chilled to -9 C for at least 1 h and the metal fixed angle centrifuge rotor was frozen at -20 C for 1 h to ensure rapid quenching of cells. 1.6 ml quenching solution (60:40 HPLC grade MeOH:H2O (Sigma-Aldrich)) per flask was added to pre-weighed 2 ml tubes and left on dry ice for 15 min to cool to approximately -40 C. Cells were scraped into the flask media with minimum disruption and the cell suspension was transferred to a 15 ml tube for centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 1000 x g. 500 l cell suspension was retained for DNA extraction. Supernatant was removed by pouring and cell pellets were resuspended in residual media by gently pipetting. 200 l of this cell suspension was added to 1.6 ml quenching solution at -40 C and mixed immediately by inversion. Samples were centrifuged in the pre-chilled rotor at -9 C, 2500 x g for 5 min. A maximum of 10 samples were processed at a time to ensure all were kept below 0 C. Quenching solution was removed using a glass Pasteur pipette and the tube was weighed to estimate cell mass before being frozen at -80 C until extraction.","HPLC grade MeOH (EMD Millipore), H2O and chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) were cooled on ice and 8 l/mg pellet mass MeOH and 7.2 l/mg H2O added to each sample tube. Tubes were vortexed for 30 s and returned to ice. 8 l/mg chloroform were added to 1.9 ml glass vials and after pulse vortexing, the pellet and MeOH/H2O mixture were transferred using a glass Pasteur pipette. Samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 1500 x g for 15 min at 4 C. Biphasic samples were left at room temperature for 5 min before the upper layer containing polar metabolites was removed using a Hamilton syringe. 270 l of non-polar lipid-containing lower layer were then transferred to a 1.8 ml glass tube and stored overnight at -80 C. 7 Aa23-T samples and 6 samples from each infected line were taken forward. 40 l was removed to combine for a quality control (QC) sample before all samples were dried under nitrogen, taken back up in 270 l chloroform and stored at -80 C until use.","Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (RPLC-FT-ICR-MS) based analysis of the lipids was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Dionex Ultimate 3000 system connected to the same mass spectrometer as above. Samples were dried and each taken up in the original volume of solvent A (5 mM ammonium acetate, 5% isopropanol in water) / solvent B (5 mM ammonium acetate, 5% isopropanol, 5% water in acetonitrile) 1:1 and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C and 4000 rcf. 8 l of each sample were injected onto a Dionex Acclaim C30 column (Thermo Scientific, 2.1 x 150 mm, 3 m particles) and separated at 40 C with a flow rate of 200 l/min and a gradient from solvent (A) over solvent (B) to solvent (C) (5 mM ammonium acetate, 5% water in isopropanol); see Table S4 in the publication. The gradient was designed to thoroughly wash out polar compounds before lipid analysis. One LC-FT-ICR-MS analysis was performed per sample.","Direct Infusion MS:</br>Negative ion mode Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-DIMS) was performed. Negative ion mode MS analyses were conducted using a hybrid 7-Tesla linear ion trap FT-ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Advion Triversa chip-based direct injection nanoelectrospray ion source (Advion Biosciences). Samples were diluted 1:4 in 5 mM ammonium acetate (from a 1 M stock in methanol) in methanol/chloroform 3:1. Technical triplicates were run in controlled randomized order. Data were acquired from m/z 120-1200 in 12 wide SIM (selected ion monitoring) windows at a nominal resolution of 100,000. Failed runs were repeated the same night. Additional compound identification (DI-MS/MS and MSn) was performed on the same instrument.</p>LC-MS:</br>One LC-FT-ICR-MS analysis was performed per sample. Data was acquired in the negative ion mode from m/z 120-1200 at a resolution of 50,000 in centroid mode. A QC sample was pooled from all biological samples and analysed repeatedly at the start, end, and equidistantly throughout the sequence.

MTBLS451,Metabolite profiling of the fermentation process of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi Japanese sake,"Sake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage prepared by multiple parallel fermentation of rice. The fermentation process of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi sake is mainly performed by three microbes, Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Lactobacilli; the levels of various metabolites fluctuate during the fermentation of sake. For evaluation of the fermentation process, we monitored the concentration of moderate-sized molecules (m/z: 200-1000) dynamically changed during the fermentation process of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi Japanese sake. This analysis revealed that six compounds were the main factors with characteristic differences in the fermentation process. Among the six compounds, four were leucine- or isoleucine-containing peptides and the remaining two were predicted to be small molecules. Quantification of these compounds revealed that their quantities changed during the month of fermentation process. Our metabolomic approach revealed the dynamic changes observed in moderate-sized molecules during the fermentation process of sake, and the factors found in this analysis will be candidate molecules that indicate the progress of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi sake fermentation.",Japanese Sake; metabolomic profiling; nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites,Japanese Sake; metabolomic profiling; nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites,Metabolite profiling of the fermentation process of ""yamahai-ginjo-shikomi"" Japanese sake. 10.1371/jourl.pone.0190040.

The gradient was obtained by changing the mixing ratio of 2 eluents: A, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and B, 80% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The 120 min gradient separation at a flow rate of 500 nl/min and 40 C was as follows: (i) 5% B for 10 min, (ii) 60 min gradient to 95% B, (iii) 10 min hold at 95% B, (iv) 1 min gradient return to 5% B, and (v) 40-min hold at 5% B.","The separated metabolites were detected by mass spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a full scan range of 2001000 m/z at a resolution of 100,000 with a positive scan mode.

Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using R (https://www.r-project.org/).","For detailed analysis, the main exact mass occupying each factor was extracted from spectral data. Each exact mass of 1000 Da was analyzed using the Kazusa Molecular Formula Searcher (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher/index_jp.html) with KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), KNApSAcK (http://kanaya.naist.jp/KNApSAcK/) and pep1000 (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher/pep1000/) databases to predict candidate chemicals or peptides. Exact masses of  1000 Da could not be determined because of the redundancy of molecular formula.

These factors were predicted to characterize the fermentation process of yamahai-shikomi Japanese sake.</br></br>To identify candidate compounds that would characterize the yamahai-shikomi sake fermentation process, we performed nanoLC-MS/MS analysis. We particularly focused on the leucine- or isoleucine-rich peptides, and the sequences of these peptides were analyzed. As a result, the peptides [Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile], PhePro[Leu/Ile], [Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile]Pro, and [Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile]Pro were identified. All peptides contained leucine or isoleucine (represented as [Leu/Ile]). However, leucine and isoleucine could not be distinguished by MS analysis because these two amino acid residues share the same molecular weight.</br></br>Next, we tried to distinguish leucine and isoleucine residues by their retention time on chromatographic columns using (as an example) the tripeptides [Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile], which display 23 patterns of leucine and/or isoleucine sequence. The long-duration gradient program employed for LC using the long monolithic column was able to distinguish these tripeptides. From the chromatogram, yamahai-shikomi Japanese sake contained more than one species of peptide, and the predominant one was found to be LeuLeuLeu, indicating that peptides possessing a poly-leucine motif may be important. Moreover, putative PhePro[Leu/Ile] was validated as PheProLeu by the retention time analysis using LC, suggesting that leucine-containing peptides are characteristic features of the fermentation process employed in yamahai-shikomi Japanese sake. The precise composition of leucine and isoleucine peptides for [Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile]Pro and [Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile][Leu/Ile]Pro could not be identified because of the number of sequence combinations.",MTBLC25676
MTBLS650,"Global untargeted serum metabolomic analyses nominate metabolic pathways responsive to loss of expression of the orphan metallo beta-lactamase, MBLAC1","The <i>C. elegans</i> gene swip-10 encodes an orphan metallo beta-lactamase that genetic studies indicate is vital for limiting neuronal excitability and viability. Sequence analysis indicates that the mammalian gene Mblac1 is the likely ortholog of swip-10, with greatest sequence identity localized to the encoded protein's single metallo beta-lactamase domain. The substrate for the SWIP-10 protein remains unknown and to date no functional roles have been ascribed to MBLAC1, though we have shown that the protein binds the neuroprotective beta-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone. To gain insight into the functional role of MBLAC1 in vivo, we used CRISPR/Cas9 methods to disrupt N-terminal coding sequences of the mouse Mblac1 gene, resulting in a complete loss of protein expression in viable, homozygous knockout (KO) animals. Using serum from both WT and KO mice, we performed global, untargeted metabolomic analyses, resolving small molecules via hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) based ultra-performance liquid chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Unsupervised principal component analysis reliably segregated the metabolomes of MBLAC1 KO and WT mice, with 92 features subsequently nominated as significantly different by ANOVA, and for which we made tentative and putative metabolite assignments. Bioinformatic analyses of these molecules nominate validated pathways subserving bile acid biosynthesis and linoleate metabolism, networks known to be responsive to metabolic and oxidative stress. Our findings lead to hypotheses that can guide future targeted studies seeking to identify the substrate for MBLAC1 and how substrate hydrolysis supports the neuroprotective actions of ceftriaxone.<br>","Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Beta-Lactamase; ceftriaxone; SWIP-10 protein, C elegans","Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; untargeted metabolites; Beta-Lactamase; ceftriaxone; SWIP-10 protein, C elegans","Global untargeted serum metabolomic analyses nominate metabolic pathways responsive to loss of expression of the orphan metallo beta-lactamase, MBLAC1. 10.1039/c7mo00022g.

Using this approach, we confirmed previously reported metabolomics profiles of the fast-killing (2.5 h) drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and the slower killing atovaquone (ATQ). A slow acting antimalarial lead from NITD of imidazolopiperazine (IZP) class, GNF179, elicited little or no discernable metabolic change in malaria parasites in the same 2.5 h window of drug exposure. In contrast, fast killing drugs, DHA and the spiroindolone (NITD246) elicited similar metabolomic profiles both in terms of kinetics and content. DHA and NITD246 induced peptide losses consistent with disruption of haemoglobin catabolism and also interfered with the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Two members of the recently described novel class of antimalarial agents of the 5-aryl-2-amino-imidazothiadiazole (ITD) class also exhibited a fast-acting profile that also featured peptide losses indicative of disrupted haemoglobin catabolism. Our screen demonstrates that structurally unrelated, fast acting antimalarial compounds generate similar biochemical signatures in <em>Plasmodium</em> pointing to a common mechanism associated with rapid parasite death. These profiles may be used to identify and possibly predict the mode of action of other fast-acting drug candidates.</p>",malaria; untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Glasgow Polyomics,malaria; untargeted metabolites; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Glasgow Polyomics,A conserved metabolic signature associated with response to fast-acting antimalarial agents. 10.1101/2022.10.03.510714.,,,"<p><strong>Magnetic purification of trophozoites</strong></p><p>Drug induced metabolomics screens are mostly performed on 24-30 h old trophozoites as they yield better metabolic signatures as well as less variability<strong>[1]</strong>. To enrich for 24-30 h old trophozoites, a magnetic separation was employed as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. Custom 3D printed magnet stands were assembled based on previously reported designs<strong>[2]</strong> and used to assemble a magnetic apparatus which was used to enrich for mature trophozoites in conjunction with cell separation LD columns (Miltenyi Biotech). Briefly, synchronized cultures at 5-7% parasitaemia (24-30 h old) were re-suspended to 8% haematocrit following which 5 mL was loaded into the LD columns on the magnetic stands and allowed to flow through. Uninfected and early-stage parasites were washed off by loading the LD column with 5 mL of clean complete media which allows for removal of all unbound RBCs. Bound parasites were then eluted in 5 mL of fresh complete media after removal of the LD columns from the magnetic stands. Eluted parasites were pooled into a single falcon tube from which cell counts (haemocytometer counting) were performed and adjusted to a concentration of 1 x 10^8&nbsp;cells/mL. Purified parasites, containing &gt;90% purified trophozoites were allowed to recover for 1 h at 37 C at 0.5% haematocrit before the start of experiments. Further quality and purity of the enriched trophozoites was assessed by microscopy analysis of methanol fixed Giemsa-stained smears.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolite sample preparation</strong></p><p>Magnetically purified trophozoites as described above were exposed to DHA, NITD246 and inactive analogue (NITD246i); GNF179; Cpd 9 and inactive analogue Cpd 9_ia; Cpd 55 and inactive analogue Cpd 55_ia at 10X IC50. ATQ was used as a positive control while DMSO (0.1%) was used in untreated controls. In total 1 mL of purified trophozoites (1 x 10 cells) was mixed with 4 mL of complete media containing spiroindolones, KAF156, ITDs and ATQ at 10&nbsp;8x IC50&nbsp;in 6-well plates for 2.5 h initially. The concentration used and the time of exposure was based on our time kill kinetics of these compounds as well as previously validated drug concentration and corresponding timepoints which are known to achieve a better metabolic signal resolution<strong>[1][3][4]</strong>. To resolve the metabolic profiles of fast acting compounds at earlier timepoints, a similar approach as described above was used for DHA, NITD246 and Cpd 55 albeit with a dynamic drug exposure for 0.5, 1 and 2 h. Incubations at all timepoints were performed in triplicate over 2 biological repeats. After drug incubation, 4 mL of media was aspirated from the 6-well plates and cells were resuspended in 1 mL volume and centrifuged to pellet the cells. Metabolism was immediately quenched by aspirating the supernatant and resuspending the cells in ice cold 1X PBS. All experiments were performed on ice onwards.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Allman EL, Painter HJ, Samra J, Carrasquilla M, Llins M.

MTBLS1792,Bioaccumulation of therapeutic drugs by human gut bacteria: cross-feeding metabolite analysis (FIA-MS) (E.rectale;S.salivarius assays),"<p>Bacteria in the gut can modulate the availability and efficacy of therapeutic drugs. Interactions at this level have only recently started to being systematically mapped and the main underlying mechanism proposed is chemical transformation of drugs by microbes (biotransformation). Here, we investigated the depletion of 15 structurally diverse drugs by 25 representative gut bacterial strains. This revealed 70 bacteria-drug interactions, 29 of which had not been reported before.</p><p>Over half of the new interactions can be ascribed to bioaccumulation, that is bacteria storing the drug without chemically modifying it, and in most cases without their growth being affected. As a case in point, we studied the molecular basis of bioaccumulation of the widely used antidepressant duloxetine by using click-chemistry, thermal proteome profiling and metabolomics.

MTBLS2400,Personalised therapeutic management of epileptic patients guided by pathway-driven breath metabolomics,"<p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Therapeutic management of epilepsy remains a challenge, since optimal systemic antiseizure medication (ASM) concentrations do not always correlate with improved clinical outcome and minimal side effects. We tested the feasibility of non-invasive real-time breath metabolomics as an extension of traditional therapeutic drug monitoring for patient-stratification by simultaneously monitoring drug-related and drug-modulated metabolites.</p><p><strong>METHODS: </strong>This proof-of-principle observational study involved 93 breath measurements of 54 paediatric patients monitored over a period of 2.5 years, along with an adults cohort of 37 patients measured in two different hospitals. Exhaled breath metabolome of epileptic patients was measured in real-time using secondary electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS).</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>We show that systemic ASM concentrations could be predicted by the breath test. Total and free valproic acid (VPA; an ASM) is predicted with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.63 and 0.66, respectively. We also find i) high between- and within-subject heterogeneity in VPA metabolism; ii) several amino acid metabolic pathways are significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.01) in patients suffering from side effects and iii) tyrosine metabolism is significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.001), with downregulated pathway compounds in non-responders.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These results show that real-time breath analysis of epileptic patients provides reliable estimations of systemic drug concentrations along with risk estimates for drug response and side effects.</p>",epilepsy; secondary electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry; Breath Test; Drug Monitoring; untargeted metabolites; volatile organic compound; valproic acid,epilepsy; secondary electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry; Breath Test; Drug Monitoring; untargeted metabolites; volatile organic compound; valproic acid,Personalised therapeutic management of epileptic patients guided by pathway-driven breath metabolomics. 10.1038/s43856-021-00021-3.,,,"<p>66 paediatric epileptic patients (mean  SD age, 10.7  3.9 years; 37 males and 29 females, see <strong>Supplementary Data 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study) from the University Childrens Hospital Basel (UKBB), under treatment with various ASMs requiring TDM per standard care were enrolled in this study.

MTBLS79,Direct infusion mass spectrometry metabolomics dataset: a benchmark for data processing and quality control,"Direct-infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) metabolomics is an important approach for characterising molecular responses of organisms to disease, drugs and the environment. Increasingly large-scale metabolomics studies are being conducted, necessitating improvements in both bioanalytical and computational workflows to maintain data quality. This dataset represents a systematic evaluation of the reproducibility of a multi-batch DIMS metabolomics study of cardiac tissue extracts. It comprises of twenty biological samples (cow vs. sheep) that were analysed repeatedly, in 8 batches across 7 days, together with a concurrent set of quality control (QC) samples. Data are presented from each step of the workflow and are available in MetaboLights. The strength of the dataset is that intra- and inter-batch variation can be corrected using QC spectra and the quality of this correction assessed independently using the repeatedly-measured biological samples. Originally designed to test the efficacy of a batch-correction algorithm, it will enable others to evaluate novel data processing algorithms. Furthermore, this dataset serves as a benchmark for DIMS metabolomics, derived using best-practice workflows and rigorous quality assessment.",Direct infusion mass spectrometry; Assay data processing method; Quality Control; Signal processing; Batch correction; Relative standard deviation; Reproducibility; Data processing workflow,Direct infusion mass spectrometry; Assay data processing method; Quality Control; Signal processing; Batch correction; Relative standard deviation; Reproducibility; Data processing workflow,Direct infusion mass spectrometry metabolomics dataset: a benchmark for data processing and quality control. 10.1038/sdata.2014.12.

MTBLS744,"Spatial metabolomics of in situ, host-microbe interactions (MALDI imaging MS assay)","Spatial metabolomics describes the location and chemistry of small molecules involved in metabolic phenotypes, defense molecules and chemical interactions in natural communities. Most current techniques are unable to spatially link the genotype and metabolic phenotype of microorganisms in situ at a scale relevant to microbial interactions. Here, we present a spatial metabolomics pipeline (metaFISH) that combines fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy and high-resolution atmospheric pressure mass spectrometry imaging (AP-MALDI-MSI) to image host-microbe symbioses and their metabolic interactions. metaFISH aligns and integrates metabolite and fluorescent images at the micrometer-scale for a spatial assignment of host and symbiont metabolites on the same tissue section. To illustrate the advantages of metaFISH, we mapped the spatial metabolome of a deep-sea mussel and its intracellular symbiotic bacteria at the scale of individual epithelial host cells. Our analytical pipeline revealed metabolic adaptations of the epithelial cells to the intracellular symbionts, a variation in metabolic phenotypes in one symbiont type, and novel symbiosis metabolites. metaFISH provides a culture-independent approach to link metabolic phenotypes to community members in situ - a powerful tool for microbiologists across fields. <br><br> <b>MALDI imaging MS assay</b> protocols and data are reported in the current study <b>MTBLS744</b>. <br><br> <b>UPLC-MS/MS assay</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS746><b>MTBLS746</b></a>.<br> <b>On-tissue MALDI imaging MS/MS assay</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS805><b>MTBLS805</b></a>.<br> <b>MRMS assay</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS811><b>MTBLS811</b></a>.<br>",untargeted metabolites; Marine mollusk; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; Symbiosis; In Situ Hybridization; Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization,untargeted metabolites; Marine mollusk; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; Symbiosis; In Situ Hybridization; Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization,Spatial metabolomics of host-microbe interactions in situ.,,,"The Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis specimen used for high resolution AP-MALDI-MSI was collected during the RV Meteor M126 cruise in 2016 at the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

MTBLS804,Rapid UHPLC-MS metabolite profiling and phenotypic assays reveal genotypic impacts of nitrogen supplementation in oats,"<div><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Oats (Avena sativa L.) are a whole grain cereal recognised for their health benefits and which are cultivated largely in temperate regions providing both a source of food for humans and animals, as well as being used in cosmetics and as a potential treatment for a number of diseases. Oats are known as being a cereal source high in dietary fibre (e.g. beta-glucans), as well as being high in antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. Recently, oats have been gaining increased global attention due to their large number of beneficial health effects. Consumption of oats has been proven to lower blood LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure, thus reducing the risk of heart disease, as well as reducing blood-sugar and insulin levels.</div><div><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> Oats are seen as a low input cereal. Current agricultural guidelines on nitrogen application are believed to be suboptimal and only consider the effect of nitrogen on grain yield. It is important to understand the role of both variety and of crop management in determining nutritional quality of oats. In this study the response of yield, grain quality and grain metabolites to increasing nitrogen application to levels greater than current guidelines were investigated.</div><div><b>METHODS:</b> Four winter oat varieties (Mascani, Tardis, Balado and Gerald) were grown in a replicated nitrogen response trial consisting of a no added nitrogen control and four added nitrogen treatments between 50 and 200&nbsp;kg&nbsp;N&nbsp;ha-1 in a randomised split-plot design. Grain yield, milling quality traits, beta-glucan, total protein and oil content were assessed. The de-hulled oats (groats) were also subjected to a rapid Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomic screening approach.</div><div><b>RESULTS:</b> Application of nitrogen had a significant effect on grain yield but there was no significant difference between the response of the four varieties. Grain quality traits however displayed significant differences both between varieties and nitrogen application level. beta-glucan content significantly increased with nitrogen application. The UHPLC-MS approach has provided a rapid, sub 15&nbsp;min per sample, metabolite profiling method that is repeatable and appropriate for the screening of large numbers of cereal samples. The method captured a wide range of compounds, inclusive of primary metabolites such as the amino acids, organic acids, vitamins and lipids, as well as a number of key secondary metabolites, including the avenanthramides, caffeic acid, and sinapic acid and its derivatives and was able to identify distinct metabolic phenotypes for the varieties studied. Amino acid metabolism was massively upregulated by nitrogen supplementation as were total protein levels, whilst the levels of organic acids were decreased, likely due to them acting as a carbon skeleton source. Several TCA cycle intermediates were also impacted, potentially indicating increased TCA cycle turn over, thus providing the plant with a source of energy and reductant power to aid elevated nitrogen assimilation. Elevated nitrogen availability was also directed towards the increased production of nitrogen containing phospholipids. A number of both positive and negative impacts on the metabolism of phenolic compounds that have influence upon the health beneficial value of oats and their products were also observed.</div><div><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Although the developed method has broad applicability as a rapid screening method or a rapid metabolite profiling method and in this study has provided valuable metabolic insights, it still must be considered that much greater confidence in metabolite identification, as well as quantitative precision, will be gained by the application of higher resolution chromatography methods, although at a large expense to sample throughput. Follow up studies will apply higher resolution GC (gas chromatography) and LC (reversed phase and HILIC) approaches, oats will be also analysed from across multiple growth locations and growth seasons, effectively providing a cross validation for the results obtained within this preliminary study. It will also be fascinating to perform more controlled experiments with sampling of green tissues, as well as oat grains, throughout the plants and grains development, to reveal greater insight of carbon and nitrogen metabolism balance, as well as resource partitioning into lipid and secondary metabolism.</div>",ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nitrogen molecular entity; bio-variety; grain quality trait; beta-D-glucan; amino acid; Lipidomics; Avenanthramides,ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nitrogen molecular entity; bio-variety; grain quality trait; beta-D-glucan; amino acid; Lipidomics; Avenanthramides,Rapid UHPLC-MS metabolite profiling and phenotypic assays reveal genotypic impacts of nitrogen supplementation in oats. 10.1007/s11306-019-1501-x. PMID:30868357,,,"The trial was conducted at Lydbury North, Shropshire, UK (latitude 52.45, longitude 2.94, medium soil type) in a split plot design with 3 replicates using 5 levels of nitrogen application (main plot treatment) and 4 commercially available winter oat varieties (sub-plot treatment) from the Aberystwyth University winter oat breeding programme. These included 2 of the most widely grown winter oat varieties in the UK over the last 20 years, Gerald and Mascani (AHDB 2015). 3 varieties were of conventional height (Mascani, Gerald and Tardis) and the fourth was a dwarf variety (Balado). Plots (1.8 x 6 m) were sown on the 9th October 2013 at a sowing rate of 300 seeds/m^2 and harvested on the 7th August 2014 using a small plot combine. Fungicides and weed control followed standard practise for winter oats including the use of a plant growth regulator (Cycocel 5C). Soils were sampled to a depth of 90 cm in early spring and residual soil nitrogen was determined to be 58 kg N/ha. Nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) doses were split between 3 different developmental stages in early to late spring as indicated in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study, to provide 5 final doses: Control, no applied nitrogen; level 1, 50 kg N/ha applied; level 2, 100 kg N/ha applied; level 3, 150 kg N/ha applied; level 4, 200 kg N/ha applied. The 17th April application date corresponded to growth stage 31 (early stem elongation, Zadoks et al. 1974). Prior to harvest the number of fertile shoots (panicles) per m2 were counted and plant heights from soil surface to panicle tip measured.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Zadoks JC, Chang TT, Konzak CF.

The extract supernatants were next filtered with 0.45um PTFE filter vials (Thomson single step) and transferred to 2 ml HPLC vials with pre-slit caps (Thermo-Fisher, Chromacol 2SVW and 9-SCK(B)-ST1 X, respectively). A quality assurance (QA) sample was prepared by mixing equal quantities of each sample extract, thus providing a QA sample representative of the average of the entire sample set. A number of representative samples were also extracted and analysed in triplicate (denoted as a, b, and c, within the sample number) to serve as reference samples to define extraction and analytical repeatability. The samples were stored in the HPLC autosampler at 10 C and analysed within 72 h of extraction in positive and negative electrospray ionisation (ESI) modes. The ESI source spray cone and ion tube were cleaned between running the sample set in each ionisation mode.</p>","UHPLC separations were performed with a Thermo Accela 600 HPLC system coupled with an Accela PDA detector (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. U.K). The HPLC was operated at a flow rate of 400 l/min, the column and guard column (Thermo Hypersil Gold C18 50 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 m particle size; Hypersil Gold C18 Guard 10 x 2.1 mm, 3 m particle size; Thermo Universal Uniguard guard holder 2.1/3 mm) were maintained at a temperature of 40 C. The solvent A, HPLC grade water, and solvent B, HPLC grade acetonitrile, were acidified with 0.1% [v/v] MS grade formic acid. Prior to sample analysis a new UHPLC column and guard column were conditioned with solvents A and B for a minimum of 40 min at a flow rate of 400 l/min. A sample injection volume of 5 l was employed in full-loop mode. The gradient programme was as follows: hold 5% B 01 min, 5100% B 18 min, hold 100% B 811 min, 1005% B 1111.1 min, hold 5% B 11.115 min. Autosampler syringe and line washes were performed with 80% HPLC grade acetonitrile 20% HPLC grade water. The UHPLC column eluent was first monitored by the Accela PDA detector where spectra were collected in wavelength/absorbance mode from 200 to 600 nm with a filter bandwidth and wavelength step of 1 nm, the filter rise time was 1 s, the sample rate was 10 Hz. Additionally three channel set points were employed, Channel A 280 nm, Channel B 365 nm, Channel C 520 nm, with a bandwidth of 9 nm and a sample rate of 10 Hz.","The PDA detector eluent was next transfered to a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometry system operated under Xcalibur software (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. UK). Mass spectra were primarilly collected in full scan mode (m/z 1001200) at a mass resolution of 30,000 (FWHM defined at m/z 400) within the FT detector for all samples. An additional method was applied to obtain ion trees by performing data-dependent analysis (DDA) MS2 on the top 3 most intense ions for the mixed QA sample[1]. The DDA method applied a primary full scan event within the FT, followed by a secondary scan event within the LTQ-IT to collect MS2 CID fragmentation spectra for the top 3 most intense ions as defined within the preliminary full MS scan. Helium was applied as a collision gas for CID at a normalised collision energy of 45%, a trapping window width of 2 ( 1) m/z was applied, an activation time of 30 ms and activation Q of 0.25 were applied, only singly charged ions were selected for DDA, isotopic ions were also excluded. The preliminary full scan event within the FT generated profile mode data, whereas the LTQ-IT MS2 data were collected in 'centroid' mode.</br></br>A scan speed of 0.1 s and 0.4 s were applied in the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. The Automatic Gain Control was set to 1 x 10^5 and 1 x 10^6 for the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. Prior to the analytical run the LTQ-IT and FT-MS were tuned to optimise conditions for the detection of ions in the mid detection range of m/z 1001200, as well as being calibrated with the manufacturers recommended calibration mixture and procedures. The ESI conditions were optimised to allow efficient ionisation and ion transmission whilst limiting insource fragmentation. The following settings were applied to ESI: Spray voltage 3.5 kV (ESI) and +4.5 kV (ESI+); Sheath gas 60; Auxiliary gas 30; Capillary voltage 35 V (ESI)+35 V (ESI+); Tube lens voltage 100 V (ESI) and +100 V (ESI+); Capillary temperature 280 C; ESI probe temperature 100 C.</br></br>The samples were analysed in a completely randomised order as 2 independent analytical blocks, each of approximately 100 injections, respective of ESI positive and ESI negative polarities. For each analytical block, initially 8 injections of QA sample were performed for LC-MS system conditioning, after which 3 further injections of QA sample were performed, followed by 6 injections of experimental samples and a further QA injection. This was repeated until all samples were analysed, finally the analytical block was concluded with a further 3 QA injections. A control blank sample was analysed at the start and end of the analytical block, thus providing a measure of the sample background and also a measure of compound carry over resulting from dirtying of the ESI source. Each analytical block was finally concluded by collection of the DDA MS2 profiles for the QA sample.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Mullard G, Allwood JW, Webber RJM, Brown M, Begley P, Hollywood KA, Jones M, Unwin RD, Bishop PN, Cooper GJS, Dunn WB.

Each MZML based three-dimensional data matrix (intensityxm/zxtime1 per sample) was converted (or deconvolved) into a vector of peak responses, where a peak response is defined as the sum of intensities over a window of specified mass and time range (e.g. m/z = 102.1  0.01 and time = 130  10 s). In this experiment the deconvolution was performed using the freely available XCMS online package (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/). XCMS online was operated with the following parameter set points: Feature detection; methodCentWave; mass error 5 ppm, minimum and maximum peak width 5 and 30 s respectively, mzdiff 0.01, S/N threshold 10, integration method 1, prefilter peaks 3, prefilter intensity 40,000, noise filter 100,000: RT correction; method  Obiwarp, profstep 1: Alignment; minfrac 0.5, mz width 0.015, bw 5, min samp 1, max samp 100: Annotation; Search for isotopes + adducts, mz absolute error 0.015, ppm error 5.</br></br>The XCMS deconvolution results in the production of a Microsoft Excel based XY matrix containing the paired RT and m/z of each feature, along with the peak area in each profiled sample, and where provided, adduct and isotope annotations for each m/z. The XY matrix was trimmed of peaks that eluted within the first 0.3 min and final 4 min of chromatography (the void and equilibration periods), as well as removal of peaks that were dominant within blank sample extracts (more than 2 more intense than the peaks highest intensity within a biological sample)[1]. </br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Di Guida R, Engel J, Allwood JW, Weber RJ, Jones MR, Sommer U, Viant MR, Dunn WB.

PMID:27123000</br>","Applying a set of workflows known as PutMedID which are operated within the Taverna Workbench 1.7.2 software package[1]-[3], peak to peak Pearson correlations were first calculated within a 5 s moving RT window, peaks that show a high level of Pearson correlation (greater than 0.8) within the same RT window were grouped as m/z features that were likely associated with the same compound (i.e. an m/z group). As a second step, accurate mass differences between m/z within each peak group were calculated to allow the annotation of the parent m/z from isotopic and adduct ions. Consensus was drawn between the two methods of peak annotation performed within XCMS online and PutMedID. Once the parent ion, adducts and isotopes are annotated within each peak group, the neutral accurate mass is calculated for each ion (5 ppm mass error) and in turn matched to possible molecular formula(s), which are then matched to metabolite name(s). Molecular formula and metabolite matching were based upon a library of known plant metabolites obtained from the Plant Metabolic Network PlantCyc database (http://www.plantcyc.org) in addition to the Manchester Metabolomics Database (MMD: http://dbkgroup.org/MMD/), thus in most cases providing an MSI level 2 or 3 identification[4]. Where multiple putative molecular formula or metabolite identifications were obtained by the peak annotation approach, the identifications were also manually checked for having been previously reported as an oat metabolite (FooDB: http://foodb.ca/), thus increasing confidence in the assigned putative identification(s). In the case of lipids where multiple isomeric species could be assigned to a given accurate mass, the lipids fatty acid chain lengths and numbers of unsaturated bonds were summed in order to condense the high numbers of isomeric identifications.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Brown M, Dunn WB, Dobson P, Patel Y, Winder CL, Francis-McIntyre S, Begley P, Carroll K, Broadhurst D, Tseng A, Swainston N, Spasic I, Goodacre R, Kell DB.

MTBLS4046,Transcriptional Shift and Metabolic Adaptations during Leishmania Quiescence Using Stationary Phase and Drug Pressure as Models,"<p>Microorganisms can adopt a quiescent physiological condition which acts as a survival strategy under unfavourable conditions. Quiescent cells are characterized by slow or non-proliferation and deep down-regulation of processes related to biosynthesis. Although quiescence has been described mostly in bacteria, this survival skill is widespread, including in eukaryotic microorganisms. In <em>Leishmania</em>, a digenetic parasitic protozoan that causes a major infectious disease, quiescence has been demonstrated, but molecular and metabolic features enabling its maintenance are unknown. Here we quantified the transcriptome and metabolome of <em>Leishmania</em> promastigotes and amastigotes where quiescence was induced <em>in vitro</em> either through drug pressure or by stationary phase. Quiescent cells have a global and coordinated reduction in overall transcription, with levels dropping to as low as 0.4% of those in proliferating cells. However, a subset of transcripts did not follow this trend and were relatively upregulated in quiescent populations, including those encoding membrane components such as amastins and GP63 or processes such as autophagy. The metabolome followed a similar trend of overall downregulation albeit to a lesser magnitude than the transcriptome. Noteworthy, among the commonly upregulated metabolites were those involved in carbon sources as an alternative to glucose. This first integrated two omics layers affords novel insights into cell regulation and shows commonly modulated features across stimuli and stages.</p>",cell quiescence; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Transcriptomics; Glasgow Polyomics,cell quiescence; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Transcriptomics; Glasgow Polyomics,Transcriptional Shift and Metabolic Adaptations during Leishmania Quiescence Using Stationary Phase and Drug Pressure as Models. 10.3390/microorganisms10010097. PMID:35056546,,,"<p><strong>Leishmania Clinical Isolate and Cell Culture</strong></p><p>The clinical isolate MHOM/PE/04/PER091 (provided by the Institute of Tropical Medicine Alexander von Humboldt) was used to generate the transgenic clone MHOM/PE/04/PER091 EGFPCl1 on which all the further experimental work was performed. Promastigotes were maintained in complete M199 (M199 medium at pH 7.2 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, hemin 5 mg/L, 50 g/mL of hygromycin gold, 100 units/mL of penicillin and 100 g/mL of streptomycin) at 26 C with passages performed twice per week. To obtain axenic amastigotes, 1 mL of stationary promastigotes was centrifuged (1500 x g, 5 min) and the pellet was re-suspended in 5 mL of complete MAA (M199 at pH 5.5, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, glucose 2.5 g/L, 5 g of tryptic soy broth, hemin 5 mg/L, 25 g/mL of hygromycin gold, 100 units/mL of penicillin and 100 g/mL of streptomycin) and incubated at 34 C. Morphological amastigogenesis was observed at day 3, and the strain was maintained indefinitely as amastigotes with passages performed twice per week. Samples for experimental analysis were prepared in complete M199 and MAA, but without hygromycin. For the preparation of parasites under drug pressure, an equal volume of exponentially growing parasites were mixed with complete M199 or MAA containing 2 g/mL of potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate (PAT) (Sigma Aldrich 383376, Sigma-Aldrich: St. Louis, MO, USA). The final concentration represented approximately 10 the PAT IC50 in promastigotes, as measured by the resazurin test.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Development of an EGFP Clonal Line</strong></p><p>Enhanced GFP (EGFP) was integrated within the 18S ribosomal DNA locus with the use of the pLEXSY-hyg2 system (Jena Bioscience), as previously reported<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>. A clonal line was obtained from the transgenic rEGFP parasites with the micro-drop method<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Promastigotes and Amastigotes Enrichment with Ficoll and Percoll Gradients</strong></p><p><em>Leishmania</em> cells with good viability were enriched with Ficoll and Percoll gradients<strong>[4]</strong>. Briefly, promastigotes in the stationary phase or after 48 h of PAT pressure were harvested and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 4 mL of non-supplemented M199. The suspension of cells were added as the last layer of a Ficoll gradient (Ficoll Type 400) prepared in 15 mL tubes containing 2 mL of Ficoll 20% at the bottom and Ficoll 10% on top. Gradients were centrifuged at 1300 x g for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the fraction of Ficoll 10% was recovered and washed with 10 mL of cold PBS. After centrifugation at 25,000 x g for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of cold PBS. Cell numbers per mL were calculated and aliquots for both RNAseq (2 x 10^7 cells) or metabolomics (4 x 10^7 cells) were prepared. The pellets for RNAseq were stored at -80 C, whereas samples for metabolomics were processed immediately after harvesting. An extra aliquot of each sample was taken for the monitoring of EGFP expression and cell viability. Amastigotes in stationary phase or after 48 h of PAT pressure were harvested and centrifuged at 2000 x g for 5 min. Viable amastigotes in the stationary phase or under drug pressure were enriched with a Percoll gradient. Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in 5 mL of M199. The cellular clusters were disrupted by passing the medium through a 26 G needle over 3 times. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 5 min, and the pellet was eluted in 6 mL of Percoll 45%. The gradient was formed by placing 1.5 mL of Percoll 70% at the bottom of a 15 mL tube, overlayed with the suspension of cells in Percol 45% and a final gradient of Percoll 25% on top. The gradient was centrifuged at 2300 x g for 45 min at 4 C. The fraction of Percoll 45% and the intersection with Percoll 70 % was recovered and washed with 10 mL of cold PBS. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of cold PBS. Counting and aliquots were prepared, as in promastigotes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jara M, Maes I, Imamura H, Domagalska MA, Dujardin JC, Arevalo J.

Briefly, peaks detection was performed with <strong>XCMS</strong> using the CentWave algorithm. <strong>MZmatch</strong> was used to annotate peaks and combine files. Data filtering and putative metabolites assignment were performed using <strong>IDEOM</strong> macro tools. Features were visually verified and filtered out when they had multiple peaks, or a not well-defined shape. The feature with the highest average intensity across samples was kept when a putative metabolite had duplicated entries. The TIC was calculated per sample as the sum of all annotated features. The clean data was analyzed with two methods of normalization. The first used as reference the input of cells that was equivalent in all conditions. Therefore, further processes were not needed. The second method adjusted the intensities of each feature by the TIC of its corresponding sample. For the purpose of differentiation, we will refer to this method as IPT. After normalization, all missing values were replaced by 1/5 of the minimum value across samples and transformed to a logarithmic scale. The metabolomics package was used to perform the statistical analysis and calculate the fold changes<strong>[2]</strong>. Briefly, within each stage and for each metabolite, the mean of each quiescent condition was compared to the mean of the proliferative condition using a paired T-Test. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control for the false discovery rate and calculate the adjusted p values. Metabolites changes were considered to be significant if they had a |log2 FC| &gt;1 and a BH adjusted p value &lt; 0.05.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Choe KN, Moldovan GL.

MTBLS6578,Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival,"Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.",untargeted metabolites; Lipidomics; targeted metabolites; Brain; Mouse Model; Slc7a5; autism spectrum disorder,untargeted metabolites; Lipidomics; targeted metabolites; Brain; Mouse Model; Slc7a5; autism spectrum disorder,Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival. 10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.037.

MTBLS3672,"Metabolic signatures of Arabidopsis thaliana abiotic stress responses elucidate patterns in stress priming, acclimation, and recovery","<p>Temperature, water and light are 3 abiotic stress factors that have major influences on plant growth, development and reproduction. Plants can be primed by a prior mild stress to enhance their resistance to future stress. We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> 11-day-old seedlings abiotic stress responses including heat (with and without priming), cold (with and without priming), water-deficit and high-light before and after a 2-day recovery period. Analysis of the physiological phenotypes showed that seedlings with stress treatment resulted in a reduction in fresh weight, hypocotyl and root length but remained viable. Several stress responsive metabolites were identified, confirmed with reference standards, quantified and clustered. We identified shared and specific stress signatures for cold, heat, water-deficit and high-light treatments. Central metabolism including amino acid metabolism, sugar metabolism, glycolysis, TCA cycle, GABA shunt, glutathione metabolism, purine metabolism and urea cycle were found to undergo changes that are fundamentally different, although some shared commonalities in response to different treatments. Large increases in cysteine abundance and decreases in reduced glutathione were observed following multiple stress treatments highlighting the importance of oxidative stress as a general phenomenon in abiotic stress. Large fold increases in low-turnover amino acids and maltose demonstrate the critical role of protein and starch autolysis in early abiotic stress responses.</p>",Abiotic stress; Plant Metabolomics; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,Abiotic stress; Plant Metabolomics; untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry,"Metabolic signatures of Arabidopsis thaliana abiotic stress responses elucidate patterns in stress priming, acclimation, and recovery. 10.1007/s44154-022-00034-5.",,,"<p><em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> wild-type (Col-0) seeds were obtained from Lehle Seeds and were sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and vernalized at 4C for 2days.

MTBLS3893,Pseudomonas sp. Strain 273 Incorporates Organofluorine into the Lipid Bilayer during Growth with Fluorinated Alkanes,"Anthropogenic organofluorine compounds are recalcitrant, globally distributed, and a human health concern. Although rare, natural processes synthesize fluorinated compounds, and some bacteria have evolved mechanisms to metabolize organofluorine compounds. <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain 273 grows with 1-fluorodecane (FD) and 1,10-difluorodecane (DFD) as carbon sources, but inorganic fluoride release was not stoichiometric. Metabolome studies revealed that this bacterium produces fluorinated anabolites and phospholipids. Mass spectrometric fatty acid profiling detected fluorinated long-chain (i.e., C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>19</sub>) fatty acids in strain 273 cells grown with FD or DFD, and lipidomic profiling determined that 7.5  0.2 and 82.0  1.0% of the total phospholipids in strain 273 grown with FD or DFD, respectively, were fluorinated. The detection of the fluorinated metabolites and macromolecules represents a heretofore unrecognized sink for organofluorine, an observation with consequences for the environmental fate and transport of fluorinated aliphatic compounds.",Lipidomics; organofluorine compound; environmental contaminant; fluorinated lipids; Lipid Metabolism Pathway; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,Lipidomics; organofluorine compound; environmental contaminant; fluorinated lipids; Lipid Metabolism Pathway; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,<i>Pseudomonas</i> sp.

Despite covering less than 0.1% of coastal regions, they have the capacity to bury up to 10% of marine organic matter and can bury the same amount of carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests. On land, the soils ability to sequestrate carbon is intimately linked to microbial metabolism. Despite the growing attention to the link between plant production, microbial communities, and the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, these processes remain enigmatic in the sea. Here, we show that seagrasses excrete organic sugars, namely in the form of sucrose, into their rhizospheres. Surprisingly, the microbial communities living underneath meadows do not fully use this sugar stock in their metabolism. Instead, sucrose piles up in the sediments to mM concentrations underneath multiple types of seagrass meadows. Sediment incubation experiments show that microbial communities living underneath a meadow use sucrose at low metabolic rates. Our metagenomic analyses revealed that the distinct community of microorganisms occurring underneath meadows is limited in their ability to degrade simple sugars, which allows these compounds to persist in the environment over relatively long periods of time. Our findings reveal how seagrasses form blue carbon stocks despite the relatively small area they occupy. Unfortunately, anthropogenic disturbances are threatening the long-term persistence of seagrass meadows. Given that these sediments contain a large stock of sugars that heterotopic bacteria can degrade, it is even more important to protect these ecosystems from degradation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MALDI-MSI assay of Plant roots</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1746' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1746</strong></a></p><p><strong>GC-MS assay of Seawater sediment</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1570' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1570</strong></a></p><p><strong>GC-MS assay of Plant tissues</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1579' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1579</strong></a></p><p><strong>GC-MS assay of Sediment porewater</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1610' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1610</strong></a></p>",untargeted metabolites; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; sucrose; sea grass bed,untargeted metabolites; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; sucrose; sea grass bed,Seagrasses excrete sugars to their rhizosphere making them the sweet spots in the sea. 10.1101/797522.,,,"<p>Individual P. oceanica plants were collected from Galanzana Bay (42 449.438 N; 10 14 16.3032 E).

MTBLS677,Dissection of metabolic reprogramming in polycystic kidney disease reveals coordinated rewiring of bioenergetic pathways,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in PKD1 or PKD2. Increased glycolysis is a prominent feature of the disease, but how it impacts on other metabolic pathways is unknown. Here, we present an analysis of mouse Pkd1 mutant cells and kidneys to investigate the metabolic reprogramming of this pathology. We show that loss of Pkd1 leads to profound metabolic changes that affect glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis (FAS). We find that Pkd1-mutant cells preferentially use glutamine to fuel the TCA cycle and to sustain FAS. Interfering with either glutamine uptake or FAS retards cell growth and survival.

MTBLS7060,The Toxoplasma monocarboxylate transporters are involved in the metabolism within the apicoplast and are linked to parasite survival,"<p>The apicoplast is a four-membrane plastid found in the apicomplexans, which harbors biosynthesis and organelle housekeeping activities in the matrix. However, the mechanism driving the flux of metabolites, in and out, remains unknown. Here we used TurboID and genome engineering to identify apicoplast transporters in Toxoplasma gondii. Among the many novel transporters, we show that one pair of apicomplexan monocarboxylate transporters (AMTs) appears to be evolved from the putative host cell that engulfed a red alga. Protein depletion showed that AMT1 and AMT2 are critical for parasite growth. Metabolite analyses supported the notion that AMT1 and AMT2 are associated with biosynthesis of isoprenoids and fatty acids. However, stronger phenotypic defects were observed for AMT2, including in the inability to establish T. gondii parasite virulence in mice. This study clarifies, significantly, the mystery of apicoplast transporter composition and reveals the importance of the pair of AMTs in maintaining the apicoplast activity in apicomplexans.</p>",Toxoplasma; untargeted metabolites; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; auxin-inducible degron,Toxoplasma; untargeted metabolites; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; auxin-inducible degron,The Toxoplasma monocarboxylate transporters are involved in the metabolism within the apicoplast and are linked to parasite survival. 10.7554/elife.88866.1.,,,"<p><strong>Parasite and host cell culture</strong></p><p>The previously described lines RHdeltaku80deltahxgprt<strong>[1]</strong> and RHdeltaku80deltahxgprt/TIR1<strong>[2]</strong>, referred to as RHku80and TIR1, were used to generate the transgenic lines (T. gondii tachyzoites) reported here. The parental lines and derived lines (<strong>Data S1</strong>&nbsp;in the paper associated with this study) were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts HFF-1 (ATCC SCRC-1041) in D5 media composed of Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (12800-082, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10099-141, Gibco), 2mM glutamine (G0200, Solarbio Biotech) and 100 units penicillin-streptomycin (P1410, Solarbio Biotech) at 37 C with 5% CO2.

Briefly, the pCas9-sgRNA plasmids were generated using a previously described plasmid (Addgene 54467) as the template, and 3 fragments were amplified using 3 pairs of primers named as Cas9-F1/R1, Cas9-sgRNA xx/Cas9-R2 and Cas9-F2/R3 (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The Cas9-sgRNA xx primer contains the sgRNA sequences (20 mer) which target a specific locus either upstream of the start codon (pCas9-sgRNA 5) or downstream of the stop codon (pCas9-sgRNA 3). The sgRNA design was selected from the prediction webpage<strong>[5]</strong>. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the C-terminus of a gene were generated previously<strong>[4]</strong>, such as pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR (addgene 86669), pLinker-AID-Ty-HXGPRT (addgene 86667) and pLinker-AID-3xHA-HXGPRT (addgene 86553), or generated in this study by cloning the fragment of AID-Ty or TurboID-Ty (amplified from addgene 1116904) into the backbone of pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR, producing pLinker-AID-Ty-DHFR and pLinker-TurboID-Ty-DHFR. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the N-terminus of a gene were generated using the backbone of a plasmid named pN-Ty-DHFR or pN-Ty-HXGPRT<strong>[6]</strong>, by replacement of the Ty region with Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, C-myc-AID, 6HA or 6Ty.

In brief, the CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3 plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 5 plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) can efficiently produce Cas9 and sgRNA to create DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in parasites, and facilitates the integration of a tagging amplicon. The amplicon for the C-terminal tagging was generated from a generic plasmid (with the name pLinker-) containing a tag (6HA, AID-3xHA, AID-3Ty, 6Ty or TurboID-3Ty, etc) as described above, using a pair of primers L and T (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The amplicon for the N-terminal tagging was generated from a generic tagging plasmid (with the name pN-) containing a tag (Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, myc-AID) using a pair of primers M and NL. The amplicon was then combined with the corresponding CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3 or 5 plasmid (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and transfected into recipient lines. The drug selection was followed on the second day based on the resistance marker used in the amplicons. The resistance markers with LoxP sites were excised by transfection with pmini-Cre<strong>[7]</strong>.

MTBLS805,"Spatial metabolomics of in situ, host-microbe interactions (On-tissue MALDI imaging MS/MS assay)","Spatial metabolomics describes the location and chemistry of small molecules involved in metabolic phenotypes, defense molecules and chemical interactions in natural communities. Most current techniques are unable to spatially link the genotype and metabolic phenotype of microorganisms in situ at a scale relevant to microbial interactions. Here, we present a spatial metabolomics pipeline (metaFISH) that combines fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy and high-resolution atmospheric pressure mass spectrometry imaging (AP-MALDI-MSI) to image host-microbe symbioses and their metabolic interactions. metaFISH aligns and integrates metabolite and fluorescent images at the micrometer-scale for a spatial assignment of host and symbiont metabolites on the same tissue section. To illustrate the advantages of metaFISH, we mapped the spatial metabolome of a deep-sea mussel and its intracellular symbiotic bacteria at the scale of individual epithelial host cells. Our analytical pipeline revealed metabolic adaptations of the epithelial cells to the intracellular symbionts, a variation in metabolic phenotypes in one symbiont type, and novel symbiosis metabolites. metaFISH provides a culture-independent approach to link metabolic phenotypes to community members in situ - a powerful tool for microbiologists across fields. <br><br> <b>On-tissue MALDI imaging MS/MS assay</b> protocols and data are reported in the current study <b>MTBLS805</b>.<br><br> <b>MALDI imaging MS assay</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <a href=""https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS744""><b>MTBLS744</b></a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS/MS assay</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <a href=""https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS746""><b>MTBLS746</b></a>.<br> <b>MRMS assay</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <a href=""https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS811""><b>MTBLS811</b></a>.<br>",Marine mollusk; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; Symbiosis; In Situ Hybridization; tandem mass spectrometry; targeted metabolites,Marine mollusk; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation imaging mass spectrometry; Symbiosis; In Situ Hybridization; tandem mass spectrometry; targeted metabolites,Spatial metabolomics of host-microbe interactions in situ.,,,"The Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis specimen used for high resolution AP-MALDI-MSI was collected during the RV Meteor M126 cruise in 2016 at the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

MTBLS1707,Characterisation of monophasic solvent-based tissue extractions for detection of polar metabolites and lipids applying UHPLC-MS clinical metabolic phenotyping assays,"<p>Metabolic phenotyping of tissues uses metabolomics and lipidomics to measure the relative polar and non-polar (lipid) metabolite levels in biological samples. This approach aims to understand disease biochemistry and identify biochemical markers of disease. Sample preparation methods must be reproducible, sensitive (high metabolite and lipid yield), and ideally rapid. We evaluated three biphasic methods for polar and non-polar compound extraction (chloroform/methanol/water; dichloromethane/methanol/water; methyl tert-butyl ether [MTBE]/methanol/water), a monophasic method for polar compound extraction (acetonitrile/methanol/water) and a monophasic method for non-polar compound extraction (isopropanol/water). All methods were applied to sheep heart, kidney, and liver tissue. Polar extracts were analysed by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and non-polar extracts by C18 reversed phase UHPLC-MS. Method reproducibility and yield was assessed using multiple annotated endogenous compounds (putatively and MS/MS annotated). Monophasic methods had the highest yield and high reproducibility for both polar (positive ion: median RSD&lt;18%; negative ion: median RSD&lt;28%) and non-polar (positive and negative ion: median RSD&lt;15%) extractions for heart, kidney, and liver. The polar monophasic method extracted higher levels of lipid than biphasic polar extractions, and these lipids caused minimal detection suppression for other compounds during HILIC UHPLC-MS. The non-polar monophasic method had similar or greater detection responses of all detected lipid classes compared to biphasic methods (including increased phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin responses). Monophasic methods are quicker and simpler than biphasic methods and therefore most suited for future automation.</p>",untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; sample preparation; Lipidomics,untargeted metabolites; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; sample preparation; Lipidomics,Characterisation of monophasic solvent-based tissue extractions for detection of polar metabolites and lipids applying UHPLC-MS clinical metabolic phenotyping assays.,,,"<p>Organic sheep liver, kidney, and heart tissue (frozen immediately after slaughter) were purchased from a butcher.

MTBLS260,Investigating the Mechanisms of Silver Nanoparticle Toxicity in Daphnia magna: A Multi-Omics Approach,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), one of the most common nanomaterials in use today, have been shown to enter the aquatic environment from use of commercially obtained products. Although acute toxicity has been shown in vitro and in vivo, there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the molecular mechanism of AgNP-induced toxicity. Much of the current literature centres on the question of whether toxicity is induced by the AgNPs themselves or by ionic silver released from the nanoparticle surface. Here, I present research investigating AgNP toxicity to Daphnia magna, a keystone species of freshwater ecosystems the world over, using a multi-omics platform of transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques. Initially, the AgNPs were fully characterised and the exposure conditions optimised to accurately assess the impact of AgNP exposure to D. magna. This allowed for the design of sub-lethal AgNP exposures that had been fully controlled for the fraction of dissolved silver ions. Secondly, using this multi-omics platform, the role of Ag+ ions in AgNP toxicity to D. magna was determined. Finally a metabolic pathway perturbed by AgNP exposure was identified, as well as two constituent metabolites of key importance. Overall, this research advances the mechanistic understanding of AgNP toxicity to aquatic organisms, and further highlights the need for greater consideration of the nanoscale in regulative legislature.",silver nanoparticle; silver(0); Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer; untargeted metabolites,silver nanoparticle; silver(0); Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry; fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer; untargeted metabolites,<a href='http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/6840/1/Gavin16PhD.pdf'>Investigating the Mechanisms of Silver Nanoparticle Toxicity in Daphnia magna: A Multi-Omics Approachi</a>.,,,"Nominal exposure concentrations of 4.70, 2.35, 1.18 and 0.59 mug/l AgNPs (AgNP High, Mid, Low and V. Low respectively) were alongside nominal concentrations of 0.44, 0.22, 0.11 and 0.06 g/l AgNO3 (Ag+ High, Mid, Low and V. Low respectively). These exposure concentrations of AgNO3 equate to 0.28, 0.14, 0.07 and 0.04 mug/l of total Ag+ ions (Ag+ High, Mid, Low and V. Low respectively) corresponding to 6 % of the respective AgNP exposures. Untreated (deionised water; no-added silver), capping agent (0.03 % v/v. PVP) and bulk silver (4.7 mug/l, 3mum average diameter, Sigma Aldrich) controls were used to account for background mortality, any potential impact of the capping agent, and to control for potential aggregation effects respectively. The dissolved Ag filtered from the AgNP stock prior to use was included as an additional filtrate control. Each biological replicate consisted of 30 D. magna neonates (<24 h) with 6 biological replicates per treatment group with the exception of AgNP High which had 8 replicates to account for potential mortalities induced by the higher concentration. Groups of 30 D. magna neonates (<24 h) were added to individual exposure vessels (250 ml glass beaker, Fisher Scientific) containing 200 ml of medium (adjusted to pH 7.0). The appropriate exposure stock (1 ml) was then used to spike the study medium followed immediately by 49 ml of additional medium to mix. Exposure vessels were kept at 19  1 C and on a 16 h:8 h light:dark cycle with no additional food or supplements administered. Tests were only considered valid if no more than 10% of control animals were immobilised during the exposure. Following exposure, animals were filtered from their medium into a precellys tube, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C prior to extraction.","Frozen animals (30 neonates per sample) were homogenised using a Precellys-24 ceramic bead-based homogeniser (Stretton Scientific Ltd., UK) in 448 mul of a 5:2 mix of methanol (HPLC grade): water (nuclease free, QIAGEN) for two 15 s bursts at 10,000 rpm with a 10 s intermission. A 112 mul aliquot of homogenate was then removed into a nuclease-free microfuge tube (1.7 ml, Axygen) for RNA extraction and replaced with the same volume of 5:2 methanol:water. Polar metabolites were extracted from the remaining homogenate using a two-step, biphasic method as detailed previously [1]. Following extraction, the upper, polar layer of each sample was removed into a single 1.5 ml microfuge tube (Starstedt, Leicester, UK) via Hamilton syringe. Polar extracts were dried under vacuum (Savant Refrigerated Vapour Trap, Thermo Scientific) using a centrifugal concentrator (Savant SpeedVac concentrator, Thermo Scientific) without application of heat and stored at -80 C prior to FT-ICR analysis. Two extract blanks were created using the above homogenisation and extraction protocols in the absence of biological material.</br></p>Ref:</br>[1] Wu H, Southam AD, Hines A, Viant MR.

All re-suspended samples were centrifuged at 22,000 rcf, 4 C for 10 minutes to remove particulate matter. The supernatant of each sample was then loaded alongside quality control (QC) samples in a randomly generated order on 384 well plates (Agilent technologies). QC samples were created from a pool of D. magna polar extract from a separately collected group of neonates. Once an entire plate was loaded, it was permanently sealed using a single, heat-sealed, foil sheet (ALPS 50V, Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). All extracts were analysed in quadruplicate using an LTQ-FT Ultra (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) hybrid LTQ FT-ICR mass spectrometer with a direct infusion, chip-based nano-electrospray ionisation source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Nanoelectrospray conditions consisted of a 200 nl/min flow rate, 0.3 psi backing pressure and an electrospray voltage of either +1.7 kV or -1.7 kV in positive or negative ion mode respectively controlled by Chipsoft software (Advion, Ithaca, NY, USA). An automatic gain control setting of 1x106 was used in combination with a mass resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at 400 m/z). Each technical replicate was analysed using Xcalibur software (Version, Thermo Scientific). Data were acquired as transients from m/z 70-590 using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) stitching methodology [1][2][3] in 7 SIM windows of 100 m/z width and 30 m/z overlap. Samples were analysed in a randomly generated order with QC samples spaced evenly throughout to disentangle MS technical drift from biological differences.</br></p>Ref:</br>[1] Southam AD, Payne TG, Cooper HJ, Arvanitis TN, Viant MR.

Briefly, transients were averaged and then transformed into spectra with Fast Fourier Transform [3] and calibrated using a list of defined peaks for each SIM window (Section 9.3). SIM window spectra were then stitched together through the alignment of peaks in overlapping regions (30 Da) using the SIM-stitching algorithm [1]. All peaks with intensities with a signal to noise ratio of less than 3.5 were removed, as were areas of mechanical noise or high noise regions in the m/z ranges of (m/z = (74.05-74.2); (90.50-90.58), (101.32-101.42); (101.6-102.1); (105.1-105.5); and (116.37 116.5)). This process resulted in four stitched spectra per biological sample; the three best quality replicates were then selected for further filtering. Replicate quality was primarily based on the variation of relative intensity within SIM windows. The spectra of the three selected technical replicates were then aligned and merged, with peaks being retained only if present in at least two of the remaining three replicates, thus resulting in one spectrum per biological sample. When aligning replicate spectra, peaks were considered to be the same if they occurred within a 1.5 ppm error of one another along the m/z axis. The spectra of all samples were then aligned and filtered with m/z peaks only being retained if they were present in at least 80% of all experimental samples. Due to the differing origin of the QC samples, they were excluded from this process to avoid skewing the filter. When aligning sample spectra, peaks were considered to be the same if they occurred within a 2.5 ppm error of one another along the m/z axis. Any of the remaining sample peaks which were also detected within the extract blanks were removed from all spectra. All spectral processing steps were completed in MATLAB (student version 7, The Math-Works, Natick, MA). These processing steps yield a matrix of raw peak intensity values, with columns corresponding to m/z values and rows corresponding to samples, which require further processing before statistical analysis.</br>Glog transformation</br>Peaks of naturally higher intensities are intrinsically prone to greater technical variation, in terms of absolute values, than those which are naturally lower in intensity. This can skew the results of multivariate statistical analysis. To counteract this, the normalised matrix was transformed using the generalised logarithm transformation [4]. This process uses a scaling factor (lambda) derived from the QC samples i.e. samples between which, theoretically, the only variation is technical and not biological. This process stabilises technical variation and reduces dominance of large intensity peaks, allows for better observation of biological differences in subsequent multivariate statistical analyses such as PCA ([4].PQN normalisation</br>To account for variation arising from differences in sample concentration, the resulting filtered matrix was normalised via Probable Quotient Normalisation (PQN) [5] using an in-house MATLAB script. We calculate qQuotients of dilution were calculated, by dividing the intensity of each peak in a spectrum by the mean intensity for that peak across all samples. The median quotient of the entire spectrum is then selected as the scaling factor (most probable quotient) for that spectrum. Quotients were only calculated for peaks that occurred in 100 % of all samples except QCs.</br>To prevent miscalculation of fold changes, missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm using an in-house MATLAB script [6]. Briefly, the top k (in this study k=5) peaks with the most similar intensity profiles across all samples were used to calculate a weighted average (the most similar peaks being favoured) for that sample. This value was then imputed in the place of the missing value. This normalised matrix with imputed missing values was used for the assessment of fold changes in peak intensities across groups and for univariate analysis to determine significantly changing peaks.</br>Ref:</br>[1] Southam AD, Payne TG, Cooper HJ, Arvanitis TN, Viant MR.

MTBLS7127,"Norbergenin prevents LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages through inhibiting NFkB, MAPK and STAT3 activation and blocking metabolic reprogramming","<p>Inflammation is thought to be a key cause of many chronic diseases and cancer. However, current therapeutic agents to control inflammation have limited long-term use potential due to various side-effects. This study aimed to examine norbergenin, a constituent of traditional anti-inflammatory recipes, on LPS-induced proinflammatory signaling in macrophages and elucidate the underlying mechanisms by integrative metabolomics and proteomics platforms. We found that LPS-induced production of NO, IL1beta, TNFalpha, IL6 and iNOS in macrophages was alleviated by norbergenin via suppressed activation of TLR2 mediated NFkB, MAPKs and STAT3 signaling pathways. In addition, norbergenin was capable of overcoming LPS-triggered metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and restrained the facilitated glycolysis, promoted the reduced OXPHOS, and restored the aberrant metabolites within the TCA cycle. This is linked to its modulation of metabolic enzymes to support its anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, our results uncover that norbergenin regulates inflammatory signaling cascades and metabolic reprogramming in LPS stimulated macrophages to exert its anti-inflammatory potential.</p>",untargeted metabolites; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Proteomics; Glycolysis; Anti-inflammatory; norbergenin; immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophage,untargeted metabolites; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; Proteomics; Glycolysis; Anti-inflammatory; norbergenin; immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophage,"Norbergenin prevents LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages through inhibiting NFkB, MAPK and STAT3 activation and blocking metabolic reprogramming. 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1117638.",,,"<p><strong>Reagents</strong></p><p>Norbergenin (purity  98%) was obtained from Baoji Herbest Company (Baoji Herbest Bio-Tech Co.,Ltd, Shanxi, China), Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Escherichia coli 055:B5 (Cat: L2880), Antimycin A (Cat: A8674), sodium pyruvate (Cat: 11360039), D-(+)-Glucose (Cat: G7021), D-glutamine (Cat: 158968) and 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG, Cat: D8375) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
