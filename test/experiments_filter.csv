PMID:29868674",,,"Our initial untargeted study made use of serum collected from 3, age-(12–16 weeks) and sex-(female) matched WT and KO mice. WT mice were commercially obtained C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor Maine, USA). Our subsequent pathway validation study reported is derived from serum collected from 4 sex-(female) matched WT and KO littermates (aged 12–16 weeks) bred from Mblac1 heterozygous parents. Following rapid decapitation of mice, 0.5–0.75 ml of trunk blood (blood immediately collected from the body at the site of decapitation) was collected, allowed to coagulate on ice for 30 min and centrifuged (15 min at 5000 rpm).","Serum (50 µl) was collected into fresh tubes followed by addition of ice cold 80% methanol (5x by volume), then stored at -80 °C overnight. On the next day, samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min to eliminate methanol precipitated proteins. This methanol precipitation step was repeated and the metabolite containing supernatant was dried via speed-vacuum and stored at -80 °C until analysis.","For mass spectrometry analysis, dried extracts were reconstituted in 100 µl of acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) and centrifuged for 5 min at 15 000 rpm to remove insoluble material. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by pooling equal volumes from each experimental sample.<br><br>MS analyses were performed on a Q-Exactive HF hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Vanquish UHPLC binary system and autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Extracts (5 µl injection volume) were separated on a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC 3.5 µm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm column (Millipore Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany) held at 40 °C. Liquid chromatography was performed at a 200 µl/min using solvent A (5 mM ammonium formate in 90% water, 10% acetonitrile) and solvent B (5 mM ammonium formate in 90% acetonitrile, 10% water) with the following gradient: 90% B for 2 min, 90–40% B over 16 min, 40% B held 2 min, and 40–90% B over 10 min, 90% B held 10 min (gradient length 40 min).","Full MS analyses were acquired on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Q-Exactive HF hybrid mass spectrometer over a mass range of m/z 70–1050 under an ESI positive profile mode and separately under an ESI negative profile mode. Full mass scan was used at a resolution of 120 000 with a scan rate at ~3.5 Hz. The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at 1 x 10^6 ions, and maximum ion injection time (IT) was at 100 ms. Source ionization parameters were optimized with the spray voltage at 3.0 kV, and other parameters were as follows: transfer temperature at 280 °C; S-Lens level at 40; heater temperature at 325 °C; Sheath gas at 40, Aux gas at 10, and sweep gas flow at 1. Data dependent(DD) MS/MS spectra were acquired using a data dependent scanning mode in which 1 full MS scan (m/z 70–1050) was followed by 2 MS/MS scans. MS/MS scans are acquired in profile mode using an isolation width of 1.3 m/z, stepped collision energy (NCE 20, 40, 60), and a dynamic exclusion of 6 s. MS/MS spectra were collected at a resolution of 15 000 with an AGC target set at 2 x 10^5 ions, and IT of 100 ms. To assess instrument performance and reproducibility throughout our experimental run sequence, we monitored the retention times and peak areas for a subset of identified endogenous molecules (n = 10) observed in the 3 DD QC pool runs bracketing the experimental FMS QC and experimental run sequence (visualized using Skyline (www.skyline.ms)[1]).<br><br>Full MS (FMS) data was acquired for the QC pool, in both HILIC-POS (3 FMS QC runs) and HILIC-NEG (1 FMS QC runs) methods, to use as a retention time alignment reference within Progenesis QI for subsequent normalization and data quantitation. MS/MS (data dependent (DD)) acquisitions for pooled QCs were run to assess instrument performance over time and used for feature annotation.<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] MacLean B, Tomazela DM, Shulman N, Chambers M, Finney GL, Frewen B, Kern R, Tabb DL, Liebler DC, MacCoss MJ.

In both ESI positive and negative modes, the mobile phase contained A = 25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonium hydroxide in water and B = acetonitrile. The gradient was 98% B for 1.5 min and was linearly reduced to 2% in 10.5 min, and then kept for 2 min, and then increased to 98% in 0.1 min, with a 3 min re-equilibration period employed. In order to avoid the effects of instrument detection signal fluctuations, continuous analysis of samples was performed randomly. Pooled quality control (QC) samples (generated by taking an equal aliquot of all the samples included in the experiment) were run 3x times before the beginning of the sample queue for column conditioning and every 6 injections thereafter to assess inconsistencies that are particularly evident in large batch acquisitions in terms of retention time drifts and variation in ion intensity over time.</p>","<p>Electrospray ionization (ESI) positive and negative ion modes were used for detection in non-targeted metabolomics.

In the extracted ion features, only the variables having more than 50% of the nonzero measurement values in at least one group were kept. Compound identification of metabolites was performed by MS/MS spectra with an in-house database established with available authentic standards. After normalized to total peak intensity, the processed data were uploaded into SIMCA-P (version 14.1, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden), where it was subjected to multivariate data analysis, including Pareto-scaled principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The 7-fold cross-validation and response permutation testing were used to evaluate the robustness of the model. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) value of each variable in the OPLS-DA model was calculated to indicate its contribution to the classification. Significance was determined using an unpaired Student’s t test.

Briefly, mice were generated on a pure C57BL/6N background using CrispR/Cas9. gRNAs were selected with the <a href='http://crispor.tefor.net/crispor.py' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Crispor program</a> to delete a critical exon, here exon 2 for both LAT and MX2 genes, that will introduce a change in the open reading frame and the stop of translation. After microinjection in the pronucleus of C57BL/6N fertilized eggs, 16 pups were born and 6 of them had the expected deletion of exon 2 of LAT. A line was established from one founder (hash13), the size of the deletion was 242 bps. Primers F1 (CTTCTTGGTCACGCTCCTGGCTG) and R1 (ATGCTTCTTGGGTACAAACTGGCAG) were used for genotyping (WT allele: 600 bps, KO allele: 358 bps). For the MX2 gene, 15 pups were born after microinjection in C57BL/6N fertilized eggs and 2 carried the expected deletion of exon 2.

Phenotyping data were collected between the age of 4 and 16 weeks. Both mutant mouse lines and wild-type littermates were tested through a broad-based primary phenotyping pipeline in all the major adult organ systems and most areas of major human diseases.

Briefly, a volume of 200 μl of methanol containing internal standards at 3.75 µg/ml (Dimetridazole, 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), Dinoseb (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) was added to the 50 µl of plasma. The resulting samples were then left on ice for 90 min until complete protein precipitation. After a centrifugation step at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and dried under a nitrogen stream using a TurboVap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Prior to LC-MS analysis, dried extracts were resuspended in 150µl of 10 mM ammonium carbonate&nbsp;(pH 10.5) and acetonitrile (40:60, v/v) containing the external standards (mixture of 13C-glucose and 15N-aspartate at 200 µg/ml, ethylmalonic acid at 30 µg/ml, amiloride at 100 µg/ml, prednisone, atropine sulfate and metformin at 10 µg/ml, colchicine and imipramine at 5 µg/ml) for ZIC-pHILIC analysis or H2O/Acetonitrile (95:5, v/v), containing 0.1% formic acid and the external standards for C18 analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>For further analysis under HSS T3 C18 conditions, 100 µl of mouse plasma were extracted as follows: samples were slowly thawed on ice at room temperature and protein precipitation was performed by addition of 150 µl of ice-cold methanol.

After a 10-min centrifugation (4 °C, 15493 x g, Sigma 3-16PK, Fischer Bioblok Scientific), the supernatant was divided into 2 aliquots, dried completely (EZ2.3 Genevac, Biopharma Technologies France) and stored at -80 °C until further analysis.

Samples were re-suspended in 170 µl of ultrapure water, and then sonicated 5 times for 10 s using a sonication probe (Vibra Cell, Bioblock Scientific, Illkirch, France). At this step, 20 µl of each sample were withdrawn for further determining the total protein concentration (colorimetric quantification / Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France). A volume of 350 µl of methanol containing internal standards at 3.75 µg/ml was added to the remaining 150 µl of tissue lysate. Cell debris were then removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C and 20,000 x g. The resulting samples were then left on ice for 90 min until complete protein precipitation. After a final centrifugation step at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were recovered and split into 2 equal aliquots for C18 and HILIC analyses. Resulting aliquots were then dried under a stream of nitrogen using a TurboVap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Prior to LC-MS analysis, dried extracts were re-suspended to reach a fixed protein concentration (equivalent to 20 mg/ml) as described above for metabolite analysis using C18 and ZIC-pHILIC columns, respectively. After reconstitution, the tubes were vortexed and incubated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was transferred into 0.2 ml vials. A quality control (QC) sample was obtained by pooling 20 µl of each sample preparation. QC samples were injected every 10 samples in order to evaluate the signal variations of any metabolite, while the external standards added to all samples were used to check for consistency of signal and retention time stability throughout the experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Boudah S, Olivier MF, Aros-Calt S, Oliveira L, Fenaille F, Tabet JC, Junot C.

All chromatographic systems were equipped with an on-line prefilter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France). Experimental settings for each LC/MS condition are described below. Mobile phases for the C18 column were 100% water in A and 100% acetonitrile in B, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Regarding HILIC, phase A consisted of an aqueous buffer of 10 mM ammonium carbonate in water adjusted to pH 10.5 with ammonium hydroxide, whereas pure acetonitrile was used as solvent B. Chromatographic elutions were achieved under gradient conditions as follows: (i) C18-based system: the flow rate was set at 500 µl/min. The elution consisted of an isocratic step of 2 min at 5% phase B, followed by a linear gradient from 5 to 100% of phase B for the next 11 min. These proportions were kept constant for 12.5 min before returning to 5% B for 4.5 min; (ii) HILIC-based system: the flow rate was 200 µl/min. Elution started with an isocratic step of 2 min at 80% B, followed by a linear gradient from 80 to 40% of phase B from 2 to 12 min.

Variables whose mean intensity in the biological samples was less than 3 times that of the blanks were discarded. Variables whose linear (Pearson) correlation between the intensity in diluted quality controls (QC; pools of the biological samples) and the inverse of the dilution factor were not greater than 0.7 were discarded in the Orbitrap datasets. The signal drift was corrected for each variable by computing a loess regression on the sample intensities (span = 2). Drift estimation based on samples is of interest when the QC values do not capture the drift precisely enough, as was the case in several of the datasets. Variables with a coefficient of variation in the pools above 30% or greater than the coefficient of variation in the samples were filtered out. Chemically redundant features (i.e. isotopes, adducts, fragments) were discarded based on the conjunction of 3 criteria<strong>[4]</strong>: pearson correlation of sample profiles above 0.9, difference between retention times below 6 s, and m/z difference matching a reference list corresponding to isotopes, adducts and fragments at a 0.005 Da tolerance.

PMID:34379420,,,"<p>For this study, we procured leftover plasma samples from 13 patients admitted to Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Mumbai. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee, IIT Bombay, and Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases Institutional Review Board. The patients were classified as COVID-19 positive based on the COVID-19 RT-PCR test results. As advised by clinicians, based on the progression of the disease, the patients were categorized into the nonsevere to severe transition group. The disease progression was evaluated based on general symptoms, severe respiratory symptoms, SpO2 levels, and need for mechanical ventilation. The nonsevere and severe time points are represented as T1 and T2, respectively. The patient characteristics at different time points are shown in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The detailed demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in <strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study. After the biochemical tests were performed, the leftover blood (~1 ml) was collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate plasma. The separated plasma was then incubated at 56 °C for 30 min for viral inactivation and further stored at −80 °C in cryovials until further processing. The schematics for sample collection and workflow are shown in <strong>Fig. 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p>","<p>Plasma samples were collected from 9 patients showing nonsevere to severe transition. For severe transitions, we analyzed multiple-time-point plasma samples, which differed from patient to patient. Around 100 μl of plasma separated from the leftover blood sample was dispensed into a sterile tube, and 200 μl of prechilled absolute ethanol was added to the plasma sample. The tube was incubated in a biosafety cabinet for 1.5 h until ethanol was evaporated. To the semi-dried sample, 4x (400 μl) absolute methanol was added and vortexed briefly. The tube was incubated at −20 °C overnight. The next day, the sample was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 12,000 x g. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and stored at −20 °C (see <strong>Fig. 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Samples were transported at 4 °C to the Proteomics Lab, IIT Bombay. A total of 250 μl of the supernatant was concentrated using a SpeedVac up to a final volume of approximately 80 μl. 50 μl of the concentrated sample was dispensed in the glass vial for the MS-based metabolomic profile run. To each glass vial containing 50 μl of the metabolite extract, 0.5 μl of reserpine (10 μg/ml) was added as an internal control for capturing instrumental variation. Vials containing metabolite extract were then placed in an autosampler for metabolite profiling using Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>","<p>The extracted metabolites with added internal standards were analyzed by an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS setup, UHPLC Instrument (Ultimate 3000), coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

In the first step, calibrants from the RP-LC data were used to produce a multipoint calibration curve without the use of internal standards. With these calibration curves, accuracy and precision of the QCs was calculated and incorrect substances were removed as ESTD to avoid the use of incorrect ESTD. If concentration of QCs was met, these ESTD were further used for internal standardized quantification as well as the calculation of the final sample concentrations for lipids, where LILY cannot offer a labeled ISTD (e.g. AcCa, SM and Hex2Cer) [termed: ESTD only]. In general, multipoint calibrations were always performed by selecting the 6 closest calibration levels for each analyte area. This was also the case for the internal standardized multipoint calibration for all ESTD matched with the closest ISTD by RT [termed: Multipoint]. For an easier nomenclature, the 3 levels definition of the <strong>Lipidomics Standard Initiative </strong>(<strong>LSI</strong>) (see <strong>publication supplementary</strong> in the paper associated with this study) was used for ESTD and ISTD and only Level 1 or 2 were selected here. By quantifying the LILY lipids intra-daily via DI-HRMS and RP-LC-HRMS, all ISTD can be used for RT-matched internal standardized 1-point calibration avoiding level 3 standards to quantify all other analytes. LILY was quantified via multipoint calibration via DI-HRMS data [termed: DI-RP 1-point] or via RP-LC-HRMS data [termed: RP 1-point] if it co-elutes with an ESTD in RP-LC or was not detected in DI-HRMS.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref</strong>:</p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Triebl A, Burla B, Selvalatchmanan J, Oh J, Tan SH, Chan MY, Mellet NA, Meikle PJ, Torta F, Wenk MR.

PMID:32124055,,,Pooled plasma samples (stabilized by citrate) were obtained from a regional blood bank.,"For each mixture of reconstitution solvents, 100 µL of pooled human plasma samples were transferred into a reaction tube and precipitated using 400 µL of a mixture of methanol and ethanol (1:1, v/v) as recommended elsewhere (Bruce, Tavazzi, Parisod, Rezzi, Kochhar, Guy 2009). The mixture contained 50 µmol tryptophan-d5 as internal standard. These samples were shaken for 2 min at 2000 rpm and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 15.000 rpm and 2°C. 400 µL of the supernatant were transferred into a new reaction tube and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge at 1400 rpm and room temperature. The obtained residues were reconstituted in different mixtures of acetonitrile and methanol containing 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% methanol. Each sample was prepared in triplicates. QC samples were obtained by reconstituting in eluent A and B (1:1, v/v) for analyses using a phenylhexyl column or eluent C and D (1:1, v/v) for analyses using HILIC. Five of these QC samples were prepared of each analysis. At last, a 1-µL aliquot was injected into the LC-HRMS/MS system.","The analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TF, Dreieich, Germany) Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS pump consisting of a degasser, a quaternary pump, and an UltiMate autosampler. The performance of the column and the mass spectrometer was tested using a test mixture in prior to every experiment. Gradient reversed phase elution was performed on a TF Accucore PhenylHexyl column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm) or a normal phase Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany) HILIC Nucleodur column (125 × 3 mm, 3 μm). The mobile phases for gradient elution using the PhenylHexyl column consisted of 2 mM aqueous ammonium formate containing acetonitrile (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, pH 3, eluent A), as well as 2mM ammonium formate solution with acetonitrile:methanol (1:1, v/v) containing water (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, eluent B). The flow rate was set from 0-10 min to 500 µL/min and from 10-13.5 min to 800 µL/min using the following gradient: 0-1.0 min 99% A, 1-10 min to 1% A, 10-11.5 min hold 1% A, 11.5-13.5 min hold 99% A. The gradient elution using the HILIC column was performed using aqueous ammonium acetate (200 mM, eluent C) and acetonitrile containing formic acid (0.1% , v/v, eluent D). The flow rate was set to 500 µL/min using the following gradient: 0-1 min 2% C, 1-5 min 20% C, 5-8.5 min 60% C, 8.5-10 min hold 60% C. 10-12 min hold 2% C. For preparation and cleaning of the injection system isopropanol:water (90:10, v/v) was used. The following settings were used: wash volume, 100 µL; wash speed, 4000 nL/s; loop wash factor, 2. Every analysis was performed at 40°C column temperature, maintained by a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS analytical column heater. The injection volume for every analysis was 1 µL..The analysis was performed using a randomized sequence order with five injections of pure methanol (PhenylHexyl column) or eluent D (HILIC column) samples at the beginning of the sequence for apparatus equilibration.","The analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TF, Dreieich, Germany) Q-Exactive Plus system equipped with a heated electrospray ionization HESI-II source. Mass calibration was done prior to analysis according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using external mass calibration. Additionally before each experiment the apparatus’ spray shield and capillary was cleaned. The HESI-II source conditions for every experiment were as follows: ionization mode, positive or negative; sheath gas, 60 AU; auxiliary gas, 10 AU; sweep gas, 3 AU; spray voltage, 3.50 kV in positive mode and -4.0 kV in negative mode; heater temperature, 320°C; ion transfer capillary temperature, 320°C; and S-lens RF level, 50.0. Mass spectrometry was performed according to a previously optimized workflow using full scan (FS) only. The settings for FS data acquisition were as follows: resolution, 140,000 fwhm; microscans, 1; automatic gain control (AGC) target, 5 105; maximum injection time, 200 ms; scan range, m/z 50-750; polarity, negative or positive; spectrum data type, centroid.","<p>Thermo Fisher LC-HRMS/MS <strong>RAW </strong>files were converted into <strong>mzXML </strong>files using<strong> Proteo Wizard[1]</strong>.

PMID:27941966,,,"Samples were obtained retrospectively from a clinical study conducted in Angola between 2008 and 2011. This study aimed to collect appropriate clinical, neurological, psychiatric and biological data from a cohort of 236 T. b. gambiense infected patients followed up prospectively from diagnosis to end of follow-up, and controls. Controls and patients were enrolled during both active and passive screening activities by teams of the national sleeping sickness control program. The reference screening test at that time was the CATT followed by confirmation using microscopy, with concentration methods for blood/CSF. Cases of HAT were defined as subjects in whom trypanosomes were demonstrated either in blood, lymph node aspirate or CSF by microscopy. Cases were classified as stage 1 when no trypanosomes were observed in CSF and when the CSF white blood cell count (WBC) was lower than or equal to 5 WBC/µl, while those with trypanosomes in CSF and/or a CSF WBC count above 20 WBC/µl were classified as advanced stage 2. Controls were subjects living in the same areas as cases, with no previous history of HAT treatment and who were seropositive (positive with 1 or more serological tests) but with no detectable parasites in any body fluid.</p>Samples, which were collected in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were stored in liquid nitrogen before being transported to Limoges on dry ice, then stored at -80 °C. Although the significant time lapse between collection and metabolomics analysis could lead to storage related effects on the samples, all samples were treated equally, hence comparisons between samples may be considered robust. The identification of metabolites such as neopterin, behaving as previously demonstrated in targeted analysis corroborated this. A lymph node aspirate was taken from any subject who presented with swollen lymph nodes and examined for trypanosomes by microscopy. 10 ml venous blood with heparin as anticoagulant was collected from CATT positive subject, as well as from lymph node positive patients. 600 µl of blood was used to perform the capillary tube centrifugation test (4 capillary tubes of 75 µl) and the miniature anion exchange centrifugation technique (300 µl). For subjects who were positive by CATT on whole blood, 1 ml plasma was used to perform CATT dilutions. Parasitologically confirmed cases and/or subjects found positive by CATT at a dilution of 1/16 who were negative by all other parasitological methods that were performed underwent a lumbar puncture, in accordance with national guidelines for stage determination and/or parasitological confirmation in CSF, when there were suggestive neurological signs. Parasitological examination of CSF was done using the modified single centrifugation technique. This optimised parasitological confirmation method permits sensitivity or parasite detection similar to molecular testing. All plasma, buffy coat and CSF samples that remained after the diagnostic procedures were aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. Patient medical data were anonymised.","Metabolite extractions were performed as per standard procedures in January-March 2015 (after between 5 and 7 years in storage). Samples were checked for metabolite degradation and all passed. Briefly, 5 µl of sample was extracted in 200 µl of UPLC grade chloroform:methanol:water (1:3:1) on ice. Samples were centrifuged and stored at -80 °C before being run through the LC-MS system.","The injection volume was 10 µl and samples were maintained at 5 °C prior to injection. The zic-HILIC column (Sequant) was maintained at 30 °C and samples were eluted with a linear gradient 0.1% formic acid in water (A), and 0.08% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). Linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B in 15 min, then 5% B for 2 min, followed by re-equillibrium for 8 min.","For the MS analysis, a Thermo Orbitrap QExactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was operated in polarity switching mode. QExactive data was acquired at 70,000 resolution, mass range 70-1050 m/z, HESI-II probe temperature 150 °C with spray voltages +3.8 kV and -3.8 kV, capillary temperature 320 °C, sheath gas 40, aux gas 5, and sweep gas 1 unit.

PMID:31398922,,,"<p>MDA-MB-468 cell line (ATCC, HTB-132) was used for the generation of breast cancer xenografts. Cells were cultivated in high glucose DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Vienna, Austria) and penicillin/streptomycin amphotericin B solution (Lonza, Cologne, Germany).</p><p><br></p><p>All in vivo experiments were performed on female CD-1 nu/nu mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany), the animals were group-housed and had unlimited access to food and water. Xenografts were established as previously described[1][2]. Briefly, a suspension of 1.5 x 10^7 MDA-MB-468 cells in serum-free medium and matrigel (BD Biosciences, Austria) were injected into the right flank of 5- to 6-week-old mice.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as tumor size reached 300–350 mm^3 (i.e., 2–5 weeks after injection of tumor cells), mice were randomized into different dietary intervention groups (CTRL, LCT-MCT8; n = 5–6)[1]. As mice are able to keep blood glucose levels and show lower ketosis on 2:1 to 4:1 diets, compared to humans, we decided to use an 8:1 diet in our mouse model, to reach at least a ketosis over 2 mmol/l. Dietary interventions were combined with oral metronomic chemotherapy with CPA (30 mg/kg). The healthy, 7 weeks old, mice were fed with the experimental diets (CTRL, LCT-MCT8; see Table S2 in the paper associated with this study)[1][2]. All animals were monitored twice a week for body weight using a digital scale. Blood glucose and ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) levels were monitored once a week using a specific enzyme-based kit (Precision Xceed, Abbott Laboratories, Vienna, Austria). Tumor volume was measured twice a week in the xenografts bearing mice, by using a caliper and calculating the volume according to the formula 4/3 Pi × d1/2 × d2/2 × d3/2 (d—dimension).</p><p><br></p><p>Breast cancer bearing mice were euthanized after 80 days of treatment, whereas healthy mice after 40 days. Therefore, mice were injected with 10 μl/g of anesthetic mix (ketamine 20.5 mg/mL, xylazine 5.4 mg/mL, acepromazine 270 μg/ml in saline solution), and after checking for absence of reflexes from the paw, heart puncture was performed. Mice were then immediately euthanized via head-neck dislocation. Blood was transferred into tubes (BD Microtainer® PSTTM LH tubes; BD Biosciences, Vienna, Austria) and plasma was collected as described in the manufacture’s protocol, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen[1][2].</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Aminzadeh-Gohari S., Feichtinger R.G., Vidali S., Locker F., Rutherford T., O’Donnel M., Stöger-Kleiber A., Mayr J.A., Sperl W., Kofler B.

The internal standards ethylparaben, 3-nitro-L-tyrosine and d4-succinate were used for quality control for the assessment of the system stability. Proteins were pelleted in a centrifuge (HERMLE, Wehingen, Germany) at 18,620 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at room temperature, followed by resuspension in 90 µl 50% methanol.</p>","<p>An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system consisting of an Accela 1250 pump, a Column Oven 300 (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), and an LC PAL DLW Option Autosampler with a 100 µl syringe (from CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) was coupled to a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Model Q Exactive Plus; Thermo Fisher Scientific). A quality control sample (pool) was generated by merging an aliquot (10 µl) of all samples included in the study. Prior to injection into the UHPLC-MS system, samples and pools were diluted 1:5 with Millipore water for reversed phase mode and 1:3 with acetonitrile (VWR, Rednor, PA, USA) for HILIC mode separation.</p><p><br></p><p>Each sequence started with 3 blank runs, followed by 3 pool injections and finished with 1 pool and 1 blank run. In between, a blank run and a pool run were conducted after every third sample. Each sample was measured in 4 different selectivity and ionization mode combinations, which were RP—positive ionization, RP—negative ionization, HILIC—positive ionization, and HILIC—negative ionization, resulting in 4 data sets per study. For each combination an exclusion list of the 100 most abundant ions obtained from prior blank runs was generated, to avoid MS fragmentation of chemical or electronic noise signals.</p><p><br></p><p>For RP-UHPLC separations, a 100 x 2.1 mm i.d. Hypersil Gold aQ column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) packed with 1.9 µm octadecyl silica particles was applied. For column protection, a 4.0 x 3.0 mm i.d. C18 Security Guard pre-column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was installed. In reversed phase mode, mobile phase A and B were Millipore water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.10% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The HPLC method started with holding 100% A for 1.5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 6.5 min. After washing for 2.0 min at 100% B, the column was re-equilibrated to starting conditions for 3.0 min, resulting in a total run time of 13.0 min.</p><p><br></p><p>HILIC-UHPLC separations were performed using a 150 x 2.0 mm i.d. Nucleodur HILIC column (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), packed with 1.8 µm zwitterionic functionalized particles. Additionally, a 4.0 x 2.0 mm i.d. Nucleodur HILIC 1.8 µm pre-column, also from Macherey-Nagel was applied to protect the column. In the HILIC mode, mobile phase A contained 50 mM ammonium formate in 50% acetonitrile, while mobile phase B was 10 mM ammonium formate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 90% acetonitrile. After holding 100% B for 3.0 min a linear gradient to 100% A in 17.0 min was applied. The column was washed for 2.0 min at 100% A and re-equilibrated to starting conditions for 8.0 min, resulting in a total run time of 30.0 min. In both modes a flow rate of 0.30 µl/min and an injection volume of 2.70 µl were applied. The column temperature was held constant at 30 °C.</p>","<p>Mass spectrometry data was collected on a Thermo Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ion source operating in the positive or negative ion mode. Apart from the run time of 13.0 min in RP mode and 30.0 min in HILIC mode, MS settings of the data-dependent Top 5 method were identical for both selectivity modes. Scan range and resolution of MS1 scans were set to 80–850 m/z and 70,000, respectively, using an AGC target of 1 x 10^6 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The 5 most abundant ions of the MS1 scan were isolated with an isolation window of 0.8 m/z, fragmented via HCD applying stepped normalized collision energies of 20, 40, 60 and acquired in centroid mode. The maximum injection time was set to 64 ms with an AGC target of 5 x 10^4 at a resolution of 17,500. In addition to an exclusion of charges greater than 2, dynamic exclusion of 5.0 s was used, in order to avoid multiple fragmentations of the same ions. Using these settings, all samples were measured in the positive and negative ionization mode in separated sequences for each selectivity and ionization mode. Tune parameters were a capillary temperature of 320 °C, a probe heater temperature of 350 °C and an S-lens level of 50 for both ionization modes. Differing settings were a sprayer voltage of 4.0 and 3.5 kV, sheath gas flow rate of 35 and 45, as well as an auxiliary gas flow rate of 5 and 10 in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively.</p>","<p>Acquired raw files were converted to .mzML files using the MSConvert tool of the ProteoWizard software (version 3.0.8688). The resulting files were further processed using a bioinformatic workflow in the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) [1], version 3.3.4 with integrated OpenMS 2.1.0 software [2] (see Tables S3–S7 in the paper associated with this study for detailed settings). The applied KNIME workflow can be accessed here https://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/5109.html. After peak picking, feature detection and feature alignment, data was filtered, normalized and statistically evaluated using Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) [3] followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction [4] for multiple testing.</p><p><br></p><p>The MTX study design and data treatment involved stringent filtering of 'noise' signals or such originating from the chemical background, which enabled the reduction of chemical and electronic artefacts. Along that line, the HPLC-MS signals were aligned retention time wise, followed by exclusion of features that did not exceed a threshold of 5-fold the median intensity of the corresponding signal in the blank from further data processing. In the next step, data was normalized via a robust regression to account for variations occurring during sample preparation and measurement. Features showing instable signals in the quality control runs and those not being present in a sufficient number of replicates or treatment conditions were removed. Filtering was based on peak area threshold in blank runs, as well as on relative standard deviation in quality control samples and occurrence in biological replicates. </p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Berthold, M.R.; Cebron, N.; Dill, F.; Gabriel, T.R.; Kötter, T.; Meinl, T.; Ohl, P.; Thiel, K.; Wiswedel, B.

PMID:36813769,,,"<p><strong>Parasite and host cell culture</strong></p><p>The previously described lines RHΔku80Δhxgprt<strong>[1]</strong> and RHΔku80Δhxgprt/TIR1<strong>[2]</strong>, referred to as RHku80and TIR1, were used to generate the transgenic lines (T. gondii tachyzoites) reported here. The parental lines and derived lines (<strong>Data S1</strong>&nbsp;in the paper associated with this study) were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts HFF-1 (ATCC SCRC-1041) in D5 media composed of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (12800-082, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10099-141, Gibco), 2 mM glutamine (G0200, Solarbio Biotech) and 100 units penicillin-streptomycin (P1410, Solarbio Biotech) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HFF-1 cells were cultured in the same media and conditions, and were all maintained as mycoplasma negative<strong>[3]</strong>. The TIR1 parental line, and their derived AID lines were cultured in HFF monolayers with 500 mM auxin (I2886, Sigma-Aldrich) (+IAA) or 0.1% ethanol alone (−IAA) for phenotypic assays, as previously described<strong>[2][4]</strong>. Parasites were allowed to naturally egress or were mechanically lysed by passing through 22 g needles, and harvested by filtration through 3.0 µm polycarbonate membranes, from which extracellular parasites were used for experimental assays.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plasmid design and construction</strong></p><p>All plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) were generated by a Basic Seamless Cloning and Assembly kit (CU201-02, TransGen Biotech) using existing plasmids as templates. Briefly, the pCas9-sgRNA plasmids were generated using a previously described plasmid (Addgene 54467) as the template, and 3 fragments were amplified using 3 pairs of primers named as Cas9-F1/R1, Cas9-sgRNA xx/Cas9-R2 and Cas9-F2/R3 (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The Cas9-sgRNA xx primer contains the sgRNA sequences (20 mer) which target a specific locus either upstream of the start codon (pCas9-sgRNA 5’) or downstream of the stop codon (pCas9-sgRNA 3’). The sgRNA design was selected from the prediction webpage<strong>[5]</strong>. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the C-terminus of a gene were generated previously<strong>[4]</strong>, such as pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR (addgene 86669), pLinker-AID-Ty-HXGPRT (addgene 86667) and pLinker-AID-3xHA-HXGPRT (addgene 86553), or generated in this study by cloning the fragment of AID-Ty or TurboID-Ty (amplified from addgene 1116904) into the backbone of pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR, producing pLinker-AID-Ty-DHFR and pLinker-TurboID-Ty-DHFR. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the N-terminus of a gene were generated using the backbone of a plasmid named pN-Ty-DHFR or pN-Ty-HXGPRT<strong>[6]</strong>, by replacement of the Ty region with Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, C-myc-AID, 6HA or 6Ty. Primers used for the plasmid generation were listed for each plasmid in <strong>Data S3</strong> and plasmids generated in this study were listed in <strong>Data S2</strong>. The DNA regions, including epitopes, AID and TurboID in the newly prepared plasmids were checked by DNA sequencing. The plasmid for complementation of the Ty-AID- Kelch13 line was generated by cloning the Kelch13 fragment into pN-Ty-HXGPRT to replace the Ty region and was generated using primers listed in <strong>Data S3</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation of T. gondii lines</strong></p><p>CRISPR-Cas9 tagging technology was used for generation of all lines (<strong>Data S1</strong>) that contain endogenous fusions at the C-terminus of proteins, and at the N-terminus of proteins in the parental lines of the RHku80KO or TIR1 line<strong>[4]</strong>. In brief, the CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3’ plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 5’ plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) can efficiently produce Cas9 and sgRNA to create DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in parasites, and facilitates the integration of a tagging amplicon. The amplicon for the C-terminal tagging was generated from a generic plasmid (with the name pLinker-) containing a tag (6HA, AID-3xHA, AID-3Ty, 6Ty or TurboID-3Ty, etc) as described above, using a pair of primers L and T (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The amplicon for the N-terminal tagging was generated from a generic tagging plasmid (with the name pN-) containing a tag (Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, myc-AID) using a pair of primers M and NL. The amplicon was then combined with the corresponding CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3’ or 5’ plasmid (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and transfected into recipient lines. The drug selection was followed on the second day based on the resistance marker used in the amplicons. The resistance markers with LoxP sites were excised by transfection with pmini-Cre<strong>[7]</strong>. The cpl gene in the TIR1-AID lines was deleted using a similar CRISPR-Cas9 strategy<strong>[3]</strong>. The complementation lines were generated by direct transfection with the plasmids containing the wild type gene (<strong>Data S2</strong>). Transfection and drug selection were performed with 25 μg/mL mycophenolic acid (M5255, Sigma-Aldrich) and 25 μg/mL 6-xanthine (X4002, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 μg/mL 6-thioxanthine (S96242, Shanghai Yuanye Biotech), or 3 μM pyrimethamine (46706, Sigma-Aldrich)<strong>[4][6]</strong>. The lines were confirmed by IFA and diagnostic PCR, as illustrated in <strong>Figure S3a/S3b</strong>, and the PCR was designed for testing the integration site and the endogenous region with primers listed in <strong>Data S3</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Huynh MH, Carruthers VB.

PMID:30868357,,,"The trial was conducted at Lydbury North, Shropshire, UK (latitude 52.45, longitude −2.94, medium soil type) in a split plot design with 3 replicates using 5 levels of nitrogen application (main plot treatment) and 4 commercially available winter oat varieties (sub-plot treatment) from the Aberystwyth University winter oat breeding programme. These included 2 of the most widely grown winter oat varieties in the UK over the last 20 years, Gerald and Mascani (AHDB 2015). 3 varieties were of conventional height (Mascani, Gerald and Tardis) and the fourth was a dwarf variety (Balado). Plots (1.8 x 6 m) were sown on the 9th October 2013 at a sowing rate of 300 seeds/m^2 and harvested on the 7th August 2014 using a small plot combine. Fungicides and weed control followed standard practise for winter oats including the use of a plant growth regulator (Cycocel 5C). Soils were sampled to a depth of 90 cm in early spring and residual soil nitrogen was determined to be 58 kg N/ha. Nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) doses were split between 3 different developmental stages in early to late spring as indicated in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study, to provide 5 final doses: Control, no applied nitrogen; level 1, 50 kg N/ha applied; level 2, 100 kg N/ha applied; level 3, 150 kg N/ha applied; level 4, 200 kg N/ha applied. The 17th April application date corresponded to growth stage 31 (early stem elongation, Zadoks et al. 1974). Prior to harvest the number of fertile shoots (panicles) per m2 were counted and plant heights from soil surface to panicle tip measured.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Zadoks JC, Chang TT, Konzak CF.

The extract supernatants were next filtered with 0.45um PTFE filter vials (Thomson single step) and transferred to 2 ml HPLC vials with pre-slit caps (Thermo-Fisher, Chromacol 2SVW and 9-SCK(B)-ST1 X, respectively). A quality assurance (QA) sample was prepared by mixing equal quantities of each sample extract, thus providing a QA sample representative of the average of the entire sample set. A number of representative samples were also extracted and analysed in triplicate (denoted as a, b, and c, within the sample number) to serve as reference samples to define extraction and analytical repeatability. The samples were stored in the HPLC autosampler at 10 °C and analysed within 72 h of extraction in positive and negative electrospray ionisation (ESI) modes. The ESI source spray cone and ion tube were cleaned between running the sample set in each ionisation mode.</p>","UHPLC separations were performed with a Thermo Accela 600 HPLC system coupled with an Accela PDA detector (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. U.K). The HPLC was operated at a flow rate of 400 µl/min, the column and guard column (Thermo Hypersil Gold C18 50 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 µm particle size; Hypersil Gold C18 Guard 10 x 2.1 mm, 3 µm particle size; Thermo Universal Uniguard guard holder 2.1/3 mm) were maintained at a temperature of 40 °C. The solvent A, HPLC grade water, and solvent B, HPLC grade acetonitrile, were acidified with 0.1% [v/v] MS grade formic acid. Prior to sample analysis a new UHPLC column and guard column were conditioned with solvents A and B for a minimum of 40 min at a flow rate of 400 µl/min. A sample injection volume of 5 µl was employed in full-loop mode. The gradient programme was as follows: hold 5% B 0–1 min, 5–100% B 1–8 min, hold 100% B 8–11 min, 100–5% B 11–11.1 min, hold 5% B 11.1–15 min. Autosampler syringe and line washes were performed with 80% HPLC grade acetonitrile 20% HPLC grade water. The UHPLC column eluent was first monitored by the Accela PDA detector where spectra were collected in wavelength/absorbance mode from 200 to 600 nm with a filter bandwidth and wavelength step of 1 nm, the filter rise time was 1 s, the sample rate was 10 Hz. Additionally three channel set points were employed, Channel A 280 nm, Channel B 365 nm, Channel C 520 nm, with a bandwidth of 9 nm and a sample rate of 10 Hz.","The PDA detector eluent was next transfered to a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometry system operated under Xcalibur software (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. UK). Mass spectra were primarilly collected in full scan mode (m/z 100–1200) at a mass resolution of 30,000 (FWHM defined at m/z 400) within the FT detector for all samples. An additional method was applied to obtain ion trees by performing data-dependent analysis (DDA) MS2 on the top 3 most intense ions for the mixed QA sample[1]. The DDA method applied a primary full scan event within the FT, followed by a secondary scan event within the LTQ-IT to collect MS2 CID fragmentation spectra for the top 3 most intense ions as defined within the preliminary full MS scan. Helium was applied as a collision gas for CID at a normalised collision energy of 45%, a trapping window width of 2 (± 1) m/z was applied, an activation time of 30 ms and activation Q of 0.25 were applied, only singly charged ions were selected for DDA, isotopic ions were also excluded. The preliminary full scan event within the FT generated ‘profile’ mode data, whereas the LTQ-IT MS2 data were collected in 'centroid' mode.</br></br>A scan speed of 0.1 s and 0.4 s were applied in the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. The Automatic Gain Control was set to 1 x 10^5 and 1 x 10^6 for the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. Prior to the analytical run the LTQ-IT and FT-MS were tuned to optimise conditions for the detection of ions in the mid detection range of m/z 100–1200, as well as being calibrated with the manufacturers recommended calibration mixture and procedures. The ESI conditions were optimised to allow efficient ionisation and ion transmission whilst limiting insource fragmentation. The following settings were applied to ESI: Spray voltage −3.5 kV (ESI−) and +4.5 kV (ESI+); Sheath gas 60; Auxiliary gas 30; Capillary voltage −35 V (ESI−) +35 V (ESI+); Tube lens voltage −100 V (ESI−) and +100 V (ESI+); Capillary temperature 280 °C; ESI probe temperature 100 °C.</br></br>The samples were analysed in a completely randomised order as 2 independent analytical blocks, each of approximately 100 injections, respective of ESI positive and ESI negative polarities. For each analytical block, initially 8 injections of QA sample were performed for LC-MS system conditioning, after which 3 further injections of QA sample were performed, followed by 6 injections of experimental samples and a further QA injection. This was repeated until all samples were analysed, finally the analytical block was concluded with a further 3 QA injections. A control blank sample was analysed at the start and end of the analytical block, thus providing a measure of the sample background and also a measure of compound carry over resulting from dirtying of the ESI source. Each analytical block was finally concluded by collection of the DDA MS2 profiles for the QA sample.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Mullard G, Allwood JW, Webber RJM, Brown M, Begley P, Hollywood KA, Jones M, Unwin RD, Bishop PN, Cooper GJS, Dunn WB.

Each MZML based three-dimensional data matrix (intensity x m/z x time − 1 per sample) was converted (or deconvolved) into a vector of peak responses, where a peak response is defined as the sum of intensities over a window of specified mass and time range (e.g. m/z = 102.1 ± 0.01 and time = 130 ± 10 s). In this experiment the deconvolution was performed using the freely available XCMS online package (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/). XCMS online was operated with the following parameter set points: Feature detection; method—CentWave; mass error 5 ppm, minimum and maximum peak width 5 and 30 s respectively, mzdiff 0.01, S/N threshold 10, integration method 1, prefilter peaks 3, prefilter intensity 40,000, noise filter 100,000: RT correction; method – Obiwarp, profstep 1: Alignment; minfrac 0.5, mz width 0.015, bw 5, min samp 1, max samp 100: Annotation; Search for isotopes + adducts, mz absolute error 0.015, ppm error 5.</br></br>The XCMS deconvolution results in the production of a Microsoft Excel based XY matrix containing the paired RT and m/z of each feature, along with the peak area in each profiled sample, and where provided, adduct and isotope annotations for each m/z. The XY matrix was trimmed of peaks that eluted within the first 0.3 min and final 4 min of chromatography (the void and equilibration periods), as well as removal of peaks that were dominant within blank sample extracts (more than 2 × more intense than the peaks highest intensity within a biological sample)[1]. </br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Di Guida R, Engel J, Allwood JW, Weber RJ, Jones MR, Sommer U, Viant MR, Dunn WB.

PMID:27123000</br>","Applying a set of workflows known as PutMedID which are operated within the Taverna Workbench 1.7.2 software package[1]-[3], peak to peak Pearson correlations were first calculated within a ± 5 s moving RT window, peaks that show a high level of Pearson correlation (greater than 0.8) within the same RT window were grouped as m/z features that were likely associated with the same compound (i.e. an m/z group). As a second step, accurate mass differences between m/z within each peak group were calculated to allow the annotation of the parent m/z from isotopic and adduct ions. Consensus was drawn between the two methods of peak annotation performed within XCMS online and PutMedID. Once the parent ion, adducts and isotopes are annotated within each peak group, the neutral accurate mass is calculated for each ion (5 ppm mass error) and in turn matched to possible molecular formula(s), which are then matched to metabolite name(s). Molecular formula and metabolite matching were based upon a library of known plant metabolites obtained from the Plant Metabolic Network PlantCyc database (http://www.plantcyc.org) in addition to the Manchester Metabolomics Database (MMD: http://dbkgroup.org/MMD/), thus in most cases providing an MSI level 2 or 3 identification[4]. Where multiple putative molecular formula or metabolite identifications were obtained by the peak annotation approach, the identifications were also manually checked for having been previously reported as an oat metabolite (FooDB: http://foodb.ca/), thus increasing confidence in the assigned putative identification(s). In the case of lipids where multiple isomeric species could be assigned to a given accurate mass, the lipids fatty acid chain lengths and numbers of unsaturated bonds were summed in order to condense the high numbers of isomeric identifications.</br></br>Ref:</br>[1] Brown M, Dunn WB, Dobson P, Patel Y, Winder CL, Francis-McIntyre S, Begley P, Carroll K, Broadhurst D, Tseng A, Swainston N, Spasic I, Goodacre R, Kell DB.

PMID:23571546,,,"Bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei brucei (s427) were cultured in vitro in either HMI11 (Gibco), CMM or modified media with 10% FCS Gold (PAA). Cell culture grade (or high purity) D-glucose, L-cysteine, L-glutamine and all other medium components were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 5 ml cultures were maintained in 25 ml vented flasks (Corning) at 37 ºC with 5% CO2. Cultures were grown to a maximum density of 4 x 106 cells/ml and sub-cultured by 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 dilution, every 2 or 3 days, respectively. Cell counts were obtained by haemocytometer (Neubauer).","Metabolite extraction was performed according to previously described methods [1][2]. 25 ml of cell culture was quenched by rapid cooling to 4 ºC in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1250 x g for 10 minutes, and 5 µl spent media was removed and extracted by addition of 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1). The remaining cell pellet was washed with 1 ml PBS, and the washed pellet (5 × 107 cells) was extracted with 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1) by mixing for 1 h at 4 ºC, before centrifugation to remove precipitate. The resulting metabolite solution was stored at -80 ºC until analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative data from HMI11 and CMM cell pellets and spent media are from 5 independent biological replicates.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Saunders EC, Ng WW, Chambers JM, Ng M, Naderer T, Kramer JO, Likic VA, McConville MJ. 2011.

PMID:20824428</br>","The LC separation was performed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography with a ZIC-HILIC 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 µm column (Merck Sequant), operated by a Dionex UltiMate liquid chromatography system (Dionex, Camberley, Surrey), and coupled to a FAMOS autosampler. The LC mobile phase was a linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B over 30 min, followed by an 8 min wash with 5% B, and 8 min re-equilibration with 80% B, where solvent B is 0.08% formic acid in acetonitrile and solvent A is 0.1% formic acid in water. The flow rate was 300 µl/min, column temperature 20 °C, injection volume 10 µl, and samples were maintained at 4 °C.","The mass spectrometry was performed using an Orbitrap Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, U.K.) with a HESI 2 probe. The spectrometer was operated in polarity switching mode, with the following settings: resolution 50,000, AGC 1 x 106, m/z range 70–1400, sheath gas 40, auxiliary gas 20, sweep gas 1, probe temperature 275 °C, and capillary temperature 250 °C. For positive mode ionization: source voltage +4 kV, capillary voltage +50 V, tube voltage +70 V, skimmer voltage +20 V. For negative mode ionization: source voltage -3.5 kV, capillary voltage -50 V, tube voltage -70 V, skimmer voltage -20 V. Mass calibration was performed for each polarity immediately before each analysis batch, within 48 h for all samples. The calibration mass range was extended to cover small metabolites by inclusion of low-mass contaminants with the standard Thermo calmix masses (below m/z 1400), acetonitrile dimer for positive ion electrospray ionization (PIESI) mode (m/z 83.0604) and C3H5O3 for negative ion electrospray ionization (NIESI) mode (m/z 89.0244). To enhance calibration stability, lock-mass correction was also applied to each analytical run using these ubiquitous low-mass contaminants.","Peak-picking by XCMS - http://metlin.scripps.edu/xcms/ (Centwave), peak matching and annotation by mzMatch, and noise filtering and metabolite identification by IDEOM (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.php), using the default parameters.","Metabolite identification is based on accurate mass and predicted retention time, which is accepted as a level 3 standard of identification by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI), but should be considered as a putative identification. Retention time was verified by authentic standards for the major HMI11 components and other metabolites where possible.",MTBLC16235; MTBLC17754; MTBLC17748; MTBLC17712; MTBLC16977; MTBLC17154; MTBLC41531|MTBLC45658;

PMID:39003290,,,"<p>The experiment was conducted at the Shandong Jiaxiang JG Goat Breeding Farm (Jining, China). A total of 20 healthy female JG goats were chosen for this study, and they were separated into the following 4 age cohorts: D1 (2.60 +/- 1.52 days), M2 (2.07 +/- 0.04 months), M4 (4.05 +/- 0.05 months) and M6 (6.06 +/- 0.06 months). Individual age cohort had total of 5 goats. Food was freely available to all goats, with breeding and management followed the same protocol. Each goat was uniformly slaughtered on its specific cut-off date. Under sterile conditions, the ovarian (O) and uterine (U) tissues from each individual were collected via surgical instruments and rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In total 40 tissue samples were promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80 °C until RNA extraction for NGS library construction or metabolite extraction. Additionally, we collected uterine tissues from each age group, preserving them in a 4% formaldehyde fixation solution with the temperature consistently maintained at 4 °C until ready for histological analysis. Where possible, an initial estimate of developmental stage was obtained through dissection and macroscopic examination of the uterus.</p>","<p>Following the previous reported method<strong>[1]</strong>, tissues (100 mg) were initially ground in liquid nitrogen before being resuspended in pre-chilled 80% methanol solvent by well vortex. This solvent effectively disrupts cell membranes, promotes cell lysis to release metabolites, and efficiently extracts broad spectrum metabolites, namely, both polar and non-polar substances<strong>[2]</strong>, while also demonstrating strong protein precipitation capabilities<strong>[3]</strong>. Comparative studies have shown that methanol outperforms other solvents in capturing diverse metabolites from complex biological matrices<strong>[4]</strong>. Subsequently, samples underwent a 5-min maintenance on ice, prior to a 20-min centrifugation at 15,000 x g, 4 °C. A portion of supernatant underwent dilution to 53% methanol with LC-MS grade water, then, samples were placed in a fresh tube for a 20-min centrifugation at 15,000 x g, 4 °C. Lastly, supernatant was used to conduct LC-MS/MS system analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Feng L, Zhang Y, Liu W, Du D, Jiang W, Wang Z, Wang Z, Hu Z.

The Vanquish UHPLC system comprised essential components, encompassing a vacuum degasser, binary pump, thermostated autosampler and column oven. Considering the need for effective retention and separation of medium polarity and non-polar metabolites, the Hypersil Gold column (C18, 100 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm) was utilized for sample analysis. The column set at 40 °C (+/-1 °C), with 0.2 mL/min flow rate and 17 min run duration. In positive mode, the mobile phase composition for A was 0.1% formic acid in water, while for B it was methanol. In negative ionization mode, mobile phase A involved a solution of 5 mM ammonium acetate particularly with a pH of 9.0, whereas mobile phase B remained methanol. The gradient elution profile was precisely controlled: an initial 2% B for 1.5 min, followed by a linear elevation from 2% to 85% B over 3 min. This was succeeded by a gradual rise from 85% to 100% B over 10 min, and thereafter a decline from 100% to 2% B over 10.1 min to restore initial conditions. Finally, a 2% B equilibration step was implemented for 12 min to stabilize the system.</p>","<p>The apparatus and LC-MS setup for this analysis are described below: a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer equipped with a dual-sprayer ESI source was connected to a Vanquish UHPLC system from Thermo Fisher, Germany.

Critical parameters encompassed a retention duration tolerance of 0.2 min, actual mass tolerance of 5 ppm, signal intensity tolerance of 30%, signal-to-noise ratio of 3, and a minimum intensity threshold of 100,000. It was attempted to normalize peak intensities to the total spectral intensity, and this normalized value was employed for predicting the molecular formula by amalgamating information from additive ions, molecular ion peaks, and fragment ions. Thereafter, the peaks were meticulously matched against the mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org/), mzVault and MassList databases. Compounds exhibiting a coefficient of variation (CV) exceeding 30% in the relative peak area within quality control, abbreviated as QC, samples were accurately excluded, ultimately resulting in the identification and relative quantification of metabolites.

PMID:32124055,,,Pooled plasma samples (stabilized by citrate) were obtained from a regional blood bank.,"For each mixture of reconstitution solvents, 100 µL of pooled human plasma samples were transferred into a reaction tube and precipitated using 400 µL of a mixture of methanol and ethanol (1:1, v/v) as recommended elsewhere (Bruce, Tavazzi, Parisod, Rezzi, Kochhar, Guy 2009). The mixture contained 50 µmol tryptophan-d5 as internal standard. These samples were shaken for 2 min at 2000 rpm and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 15.000 rpm and 2°C. 400 µL of the supernatant were transferred into a new reaction tube and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge at 1400 rpm and room temperature. The obtained residues were reconstituted in different mixtures of acetonitrile and methanol containing 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% methanol. Each sample was prepared in triplicates. QC samples were obtained by reconstituting in eluent A and B (1:1, v/v) for analyses using a phenylhexyl column or eluent C and D (1:1, v/v) for analyses using HILIC. Five of these QC samples were prepared of each analysis. At last, a 1-µL aliquot was injected into the LC-HRMS/MS system.","The analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TF, Dreieich, Germany) Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS pump consisting of a degasser, a quaternary pump, and an UltiMate autosampler. The performance of the column and the mass spectrometer was tested using a test mixture in prior to every experiment. Gradient reversed phase elution was performed on a TF Accucore PhenylHexyl column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm) or a normal phase Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany) HILIC Nucleodur column (125 × 3 mm, 3 μm). The mobile phases for gradient elution using the PhenylHexyl column consisted of 2 mM aqueous ammonium formate containing acetonitrile (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, pH 3, eluent A), as well as 2mM ammonium formate solution with acetonitrile:methanol (1:1, v/v) containing water (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, eluent B). The flow rate was set from 0-10 min to 500 µL/min and from 10-13.5 min to 800 µL/min using the following gradient: 0-1.0 min 99% A, 1-10 min to 1% A, 10-11.5 min hold 1% A, 11.5-13.5 min hold 99% A. The gradient elution using the HILIC column was performed using aqueous ammonium acetate (200 mM, eluent C) and acetonitrile containing formic acid (0.1% , v/v, eluent D). The flow rate was set to 500 µL/min using the following gradient: 0-1 min 2% C, 1-5 min 20% C, 5-8.5 min 60% C, 8.5-10 min hold 60% C. 10-12 min hold 2% C. For preparation and cleaning of the injection system isopropanol:water (90:10, v/v) was used. The following settings were used: wash volume, 100 µL; wash speed, 4000 nL/s; loop wash factor, 2. Every analysis was performed at 40°C column temperature, maintained by a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS analytical column heater. The injection volume for every analysis was 1 µL..The analysis was performed using a randomized sequence order with five injections of pure methanol (PhenylHexyl column) or eluent D (HILIC column) samples at the beginning of the sequence for apparatus equilibration.","The analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TF, Dreieich, Germany) Q-Exactive Plus system equipped with a heated electrospray ionization HESI-II source. Mass calibration was done prior to analysis according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using external mass calibration. Additionally before each experiment the apparatus’ spray shield and capillary was cleaned. The HESI-II source conditions for every experiment were as follows: ionization mode, positive or negative; sheath gas, 60 AU; auxiliary gas, 10 AU; sweep gas, 3 AU; spray voltage, 3.50 kV in positive mode and -4.0 kV in negative mode; heater temperature, 320°C; ion transfer capillary temperature, 320°C; and S-lens RF level, 50.0. Mass spectrometry was performed according to a previously optimized workflow using full scan (FS) only. The settings for FS data acquisition were as follows: resolution, 140,000 fwhm; microscans, 1; automatic gain control (AGC) target, 5 105; maximum injection time, 200 ms; scan range, m/z 50-750; polarity, negative or positive; spectrum data type, centroid.","<p>Thermo Fisher LC-HRMS/MS <strong>RAW </strong>files were converted into <strong>mzXML </strong>files using<strong> Proteo Wizard[1]</strong>.

PMID:27941966,,,"Samples were obtained retrospectively from a clinical study conducted in Angola between 2008 and 2011. This study aimed to collect appropriate clinical, neurological, psychiatric and biological data from a cohort of 236 T. b. gambiense infected patients followed up prospectively from diagnosis to end of follow-up, and controls. Controls and patients were enrolled during both active and passive screening activities by teams of the national sleeping sickness control program. The reference screening test at that time was the CATT followed by confirmation using microscopy, with concentration methods for blood/CSF. Cases of HAT were defined as subjects in whom trypanosomes were demonstrated either in blood, lymph node aspirate or CSF by microscopy. Cases were classified as stage 1 when no trypanosomes were observed in CSF and when the CSF white blood cell count (WBC) was lower than or equal to 5 WBC/µl, while those with trypanosomes in CSF and/or a CSF WBC count above 20 WBC/µl were classified as advanced stage 2. Controls were subjects living in the same areas as cases, with no previous history of HAT treatment and who were seropositive (positive with 1 or more serological tests) but with no detectable parasites in any body fluid.</p>Samples, which were collected in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were stored in liquid nitrogen before being transported to Limoges on dry ice, then stored at -80 °C. Although the significant time lapse between collection and metabolomics analysis could lead to storage related effects on the samples, all samples were treated equally, hence comparisons between samples may be considered robust. The identification of metabolites such as neopterin, behaving as previously demonstrated in targeted analysis corroborated this. A lymph node aspirate was taken from any subject who presented with swollen lymph nodes and examined for trypanosomes by microscopy. 10 ml venous blood with heparin as anticoagulant was collected from CATT positive subject, as well as from lymph node positive patients. 600 µl of blood was used to perform the capillary tube centrifugation test (4 capillary tubes of 75 µl) and the miniature anion exchange centrifugation technique (300 µl). For subjects who were positive by CATT on whole blood, 1 ml plasma was used to perform CATT dilutions. Parasitologically confirmed cases and/or subjects found positive by CATT at a dilution of 1/16 who were negative by all other parasitological methods that were performed underwent a lumbar puncture, in accordance with national guidelines for stage determination and/or parasitological confirmation in CSF, when there were suggestive neurological signs. Parasitological examination of CSF was done using the modified single centrifugation technique. This optimised parasitological confirmation method permits sensitivity or parasite detection similar to molecular testing. All plasma, buffy coat and CSF samples that remained after the diagnostic procedures were aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. Patient medical data were anonymised.","Metabolite extractions were performed as per standard procedures in January-March 2015 (after between 5 and 7 years in storage). Samples were checked for metabolite degradation and all passed. Briefly, 5 µl of sample was extracted in 200 µl of UPLC grade chloroform:methanol:water (1:3:1) on ice. Samples were centrifuged and stored at -80 °C before being run through the LC-MS system.","The injection volume was 10 µl and samples were maintained at 5 °C prior to injection. The zic-HILIC column (Sequant) was maintained at 30 °C and samples were eluted with a linear gradient 0.1% formic acid in water (A), and 0.08% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). Linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B in 15 min, then 5% B for 2 min, followed by re-equillibrium for 8 min.","For the MS analysis, a Thermo Orbitrap QExactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was operated in polarity switching mode. QExactive data was acquired at 70,000 resolution, mass range 70-1050 m/z, HESI-II probe temperature 150 °C with spray voltages +3.8 kV and -3.8 kV, capillary temperature 320 °C, sheath gas 40, aux gas 5, and sweep gas 1 unit.

MzXML data were filtered and aligned using MzMatch then further filtering and putative annotation for metabolic features was conducted using IDEOM version 19 using generous parameters (0.5 min retention time window for matching to a standard, 3 ppm mass error for identification, minimum number of detections of three per group, a peak height intensity filter of 1000 and a relative standard deviation filter of 0.8). Data were exported from IDEOM to MetaboAnalyst (see Fig. S2 in the paper associated with this study) PiMP (http://polyomics.mvls.gla.ac.uk/: PCA plots and TICs) and Graphpad Prism (histograms).","Metabolic features in this manuscript are named according to their best match based on exact mass, retention time match to an authentic standard, retention time prediction, fragmentation pattern match to MzCloud database (https://www.mzcloud.org/home.aspx) and isotope distribution. If an annotation was not possible based on these parameters, then the metabolite exact mass (neutral) is given.
